Why should I bear the burden of a billion dollar plus corporation as a disabled veteran living on disability? These skip all over the place. The yellow won\u2019t write no matter how much I shake the ball bearing. It and the black give a second of ink & stop. I even tried warming the ink up.

It also left a stain on my bathroom vanity that I am still working on & thankfully it\u2019s just a small one as I placed paper towels down before I opened the mess.  Next time I receive a bottle like this I\u2019m just going to rinse it off, pat it dry, & slip a non-latex glove over it to keep everything in the vicinity safe including my hands bc the ink stained the label & wont come off except if my hands happen to be wet/moist.  The ink works well on both Tomoe River paper & cheap notebook paper & dries quickly.  As for the ink itself: I love it!  I don\u2019t understand why it stained my vanity tho bc to my knowledge it\u2019s not supposed to be waterproof.  Luckily after much scrubbing there is only a tiny mark left & I know it\u2019s there, but I am really hoping my LL does not notice it.  Gonna try a little bleach on it next.  Also, I was able to mix a bit of it with a J Herbin red ink (scented red rose I believe) that I had on hand to get another shade of purple & I am quite pleased with it.  It is currently in a Dryden pen rn & it\u2019s working beautifully with zero issues. This ink R&K is in a Lamy  \u201cCandy\u201d purple pen & is also working beautifully.  I wish they offered the inks in glass bottles instead of the cheap plastic.  Tho I recently received a bottle of Pilot Iroshiziku ink with a cracked lid & zero ink as it had obviously been upside down at some point during transit so glass is no guarantee that ink doesn\u2019t get damaged. I\u2019m disabled so I generally order everything online as it\u2019s easier for me, but it appears I am going to have to venture out of my cave at some point. Lol. The ink is lovely if you can get one that has not been damaged or lost too much of it\u2019s contents en route as I have.

{"rating": 3.0, "title": "Quality not as pictured in advertising.", "text": "[[VIDEOID:ffd2a834f42a38fd089e2bfa848e4b5d]] Idk what to say bc what I received looks nothing like the one advertised. What I received looks like someone poured motor oil on leather after they stamped it then went on a long lunch & came back & tried to fix the mess they left on the leather.  It looks like they tried to distress or something which I hate to begin with as I\u2019m not a fan of fake distressing.  I find that seems to be the norm when the leather is not the best quality. When the leather is thinner or more scratched up as this is the sellers seem to think it\u2019s best to distress it.<br /><br />The stamping itself is well done. The only problem with it is that the leather is so thin & thinner even in some places that it has created humps in the cover front & back.  I am not joking about the motor oil. It feels & smells like motor oil. Their is a slick substance on my hands after touching it & I am allergic to petroleum products so I\u2019ve had to wash my hands several times & put on gloves.  The distressing job was so uneven that if I decide to keep the journal I will definitely not keep it in this incarnation. I will definitely use leather cleaner to remove whatever I can sue to my allergies & then I will have to cover it with something else that I\u2019m not allergic to, but that just adds time & money to this so idk what I\u2019m going to do yet. I\u2019ve even thought of painting it & sealing it.  Fortunately the dye job on the front isn\u2019t as bad as the one on the back & I\u2019m the only one that will see it as it\u2019s not a gift for anyone except myself.<br /><br />I like the locking mechanism & feel they did a good job on thst tho it was covered in the oil too.  That has made it easy to open tho. Lol.  However, bc of the locking mechanism this is not a journal you will be able to paste or collage many things into. It\u2019s a straight up writing journal imo bc it\u2019s in no way expandable due to the locking device.  Tho I suppose if your crafty/handy you can change out the rivets in the back & add a longer piece of leather there after you have filled it to ur heart\u2019s desire.<br /><br />As for the paper I don\u2019t find it any better than any paper I\u2019ve had in similar journals.  It has flecks & bits of other papers which I personally don\u2019t care for bc I use fountain pens & dip pens & my pens will skip on the uneven surfaces & that is literally on every page.  There are also quite a few wrinkled pages in the journal which you can find with homemade journals.<br /><br />So at this point I just don\u2019t know. I need to think about it a bit more. If I had received a journal that looked as good as the advertised one & was not covered in oil & I would definitely keep it & just use different pens or use it for watercolor or bird sketches.  This one requires more thought.  I definitely would not give this as a gift to anyone unless I ordered it to be delivered to me & had a chance to clean it up & check it out first, but if you are a crafty person who likes a challenge or is willing to take a chance & hope for one like the pic then idk maybe take a chance?", "images": [{"small_image_url": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/618CdwT9byL._SL256_.jpg", "medium_image_url": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/618CdwT9byL._SL800_.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/618CdwT9byL._SL1600_.jpg", "attachment_type": "IMAGE"}, {"small_image_url": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61P-rFbqlLL._SL256_.jpg", "medium_image_url": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61P-rFbqlLL._SL800_.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61P-rFbqlLL._SL1600_.jpg", "attachment_type": "IMAGE"}, {"small_image_url": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71Nl3PbJ0eL._SL256_.jpg", "medium_image_url": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71Nl3PbJ0eL._SL800_.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71Nl3PbJ0eL._SL1600_.jpg", "attachment_type": "IMAGE"}, {"small_image_url": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/814i9uE7cHL._SL256_.jpg", "medium_image_url": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/814i9uE7cHL._SL800_.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/814i9uE7cHL._SL1600_.jpg", "attachment_type": "IMAGE"}, {"small_image_url": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81NAc1sJFnL._SL256_.jpg", "medium_image_url": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81NAc1sJFnL._SL800_.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81NAc1sJFnL._SL1600_.jpg", "attachment_type": "IMAGE"}, {"small_image_url": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81T-aqC0P0L._SL256_.jpg", "medium_image_url": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81T-aqC0P0L._SL800_.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81T-aqC0P0L._SL1600_.jpg", "attachment_type": "IMAGE"}, {"small_image_url": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81gVkmjOZTL._SL256_.jpg", "medium_image_url": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81gVkmjOZTL._SL800_.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81gVkmjOZTL._SL1600_.jpg", "attachment_type": "IMAGE"}, {"small_image_url": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81jcv2rWVSL._SL256_.jpg", "medium_image_url": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81jcv2rWVSL._SL800_.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81jcv2rWVSL._SL1600_.jpg", "attachment_type": "IMAGE"}], "asin": "B08Z78C8K2", "parent_asin": "B08Z78C8K2", "user_id": "AFKZENTNBQ7A7V7UXW5JJI6UGRYQ", "timestamp": 1654452995581, "helpful_vote": 0, "verified_purchase": true}

That means the metal parts actually test my skin & cut it because the metal is actual quite jagged in many places. I don\u2019t know if the metal pieces were dropped or were caught in some machinery or what, but it makes for a very unpleasant feeling when you hold it & a very unsafe result when it cut my fingers in several places.  I liked the look of the ribbed design of the metal on the pen, but it made for a less than ideal experience when actually holding the pen as it was uncomfortable.  It\u2019s a very pretty pen & I found it quite beautiful even though it honestly triggered issues with my vertigo. Something about the design where it looks almost holographic & like the design is actually moving kicked my vertigo into high gear which is unfortunate bc the design was the entire reason I purchased the pen in the first place. Lol.  The issue with the workmanship should be able to ne seen in the pics as there are quite a few globs of resin or acrylic down the side of the pen which are a darker yellow stain than the rest of the pen & there are globs of what must be wood pulp or shavings in the resin that end up sitting directly on top of the top layer & you can both see them & feel them when you run your hand over the pen. Which is extremely annoying to someone who likes to pet her fountain pens.  It would definitely be worth checking back in a couple of months as the crafter gets better at their trade and/or uses better materials.  However, right now with these damaged metal materials with nicks, scratches, & paint missing & with the flaws/damages to the wood I\u2019m not in the mood for a replacement & I intend to go for a return/refund.  Though I do hope to try this seller again at a later date if I see an improvement in the issues bc I prefer hand made fountain pens.", "images": [{"small_image_url":

{"rating": 3.0, "title": "My pen is utter garbage & leaks like a sieve.", "text": "[[VIDEOID:b5de3fbb67572893aa86f7052023b9ba]] I\u2019m dumbfounded by the great reviews. Maybe I just received a dud? Idk.  My pen leaks like a sieve as you can see in the pics & by the ink collected on my fingers. The cap will not post which makes me crazy.  The clip is askew. It\u2019s like a third grader put it together with left over fittings & tried to make it fit. The fittings are a hot mess too. The gold is all scratched, dinged, & dented & it came like that right out of the packaging.  I also can\u2019t u deer and why they have 2 shades of teal making up the pen body. The very tip is one shader & it just looks like they ran out of resin imo.  The resin itself has some obvious impurities in it. Idk if it was dusty where these were made or what, but something definitely got into the mix that produced this pen.  I am a fountain pen freak & I have purchased pens off eBay for 99 cents or less that write 100x better than this pen. The nib is so scratchy it has actually torn paper & I have a very light hand & use pricey papers.  I love Jane Davenport stuff, but after seeing the cancer warnings no thx.

I\u2019m less than thrilled bc I needed this asap for a current project.  The front of the pad is pretty beat up too.  It has a very obvious dent in it which I would assume is when the interior pad got messed up making it hard to get stamps to pick up the ink evenly without applying a lot of pressure & then you get parts of the stamp that aren\u2019t part of the design. This seems like a scratch & dent sale ink pad to me which sucks bc I love Carter\u2019s & have used them for decades as I stated before.  The pad appears to be inked well & is not dry.

I have handled them exactly  one time since opening them so idk how that paint job on the cover is going to hold up to daily use.

{"rating": 3.0, "title": "Could have been wonderful.  Has execution flaws.", "text": "Update: received replacement & the second is just like the first unfortunately.  So I will assume this was made by the same crafter & from the same batch as the last.  Again, the paper has been pulled too tightly & ripped through the backing. It has also been cut through the first 30% of the pages at one edge.  There are paint pen marking all over the journal inside & out. This one has a cut down the front where maybe they had begun to make a scoring cut in the leather & realized it was going to be too short & then just put the design over it.  They did a better job of getting a deeper embossing on this one tho. The finish is worse however.  This one has a weird finish almost like pumice stones where it looks kind of crackled & porous Idk if it was done on purpose as a design or not.  I wish this crafter would learn to not use paint pens to mark up leather bc it ruins the product.  If you try to remove the paint pen you ruin the leather.  I am double bummed for having given them a second chance.<br />Old review:<br />This could have been a beautiful little hotter notebook. Unfortunately it is not. The ppl that made it decided to use metallic paint pens & permanent markers to mark all their sewing lines ruining the aesthetic.  There is not a spot on either side without a blemish. I had resolved myself that if only the inside was ugly I could live with that. Lol.  Bc there\u2019s a lot of that irl imo, but it turned out that both the inside & outside had imperfections behind what I was prepared to pay for & live with.  As a disabled person I can generally live with a lot lol, but I spend my little bit of money on writing tools & I like them to be nice.  This could have been a thing of true beauty as it reminds me of several Levenger notebooks I own.  Sadly, while the idea was great the execution is lacking. I hope they will do it right next time bc it\u2019s the perfect size to throw into a purse or backpack for a short trip or even a longer jaunt if you bring paper refills. The paper quality was not what I was hoping for either & as it arrived torn & already pulling away from its base I would not have used it anyways.  As it is it is a hard no for me in its current state. I hope that either the seller or amazon will do right me. Someone should definitely be doing quality inspection checks bc this would not have passed even a rudimentary one. The metallic silver paint pen was a glaring no staring me right in the face the second I opened it up.  The black permanent marker while it did match the journal better was still extremely obvious & still extremely annoying to see.  It\u2019s a well thought out design in my estimation just an extremely flawed execution.  I hope the seller tweaks their issues & offers it in other colors bc I would totally try again.", "images": [{"small_image_url": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61CW5ct7U7L._SL256_.jpg",

{"rating": 4.0, "title": "Lovely, but front bent  corner & toner (?) splotches throughout.", "text": "It\u2019s a nice heavy journal with thick pages.  The rose gold color is very pretty. Of course the first thing I noticed when I pulled it from the package was that the upper right hand corner had already been bent.  For some reason the quick reference page has been glued in weirdly imo so that there is no margin to the left & it makes it hard to write ur information there.  I haven\u2019t written mine in there yet bc my entire book seems to have toner or printer ink or something on every single page like someone decided to just sprinkle some fairy dust on every page.  As I intend to use this partly as an art journal I would prefer one without the added splotches all over.  I believe there are 43 sheets of lined paper after the journal section & I am quite happy about that added bonus.  The envelope in the back is quite roomy & will hold a lot of receipts.  It\u2019s a pretty journal & I suspect I will buy more from the manufacturer in the future albeit hopefully without these issues bc this one needs to be replaced & hopefully Amazon will do so.",

{"rating": 5.0, "title": "Wrong pens!!!", "text": "My review is whacked bc I received the wrong pens & I am extremely unhappy about it. I have not had a very good week with Amazon in particular.  I love Amazon, but I keep receiving packages that are damaged containing items that are damaged.  Now this mess arrives. Argh!  The pens are excellent in every regard. They just aren\u2019t the colors ordered. I wanted the purple & yellow pens & as you can see they are not in my order.  I ordered a journal earlier this week that came with some pens & stencils & the pens are too thick to fit in the stencils. These do an amazing job in them. The stencils have very tight corners & are very sharp & these handle them beautifully. I just did not want to waste ink filling them in. Lol. The first thing I noticed about these pens was the heft. I love a pen with some heft to it. Even tho I\u2019ve had hand surgery & I can no longer write, paint, or draw as long as I used to I have always loved the feel of a well balanced writing instrument in my hand. These aren\u2019t exactly balanced lol bc of the ink distribution & the plastic fatigue finger rest, but it feels nice in my hand.  I\u2019m just thoroughly ticked off that these are not what I paid for & what I have been waiting for. Lol.

{"rating": 3.0, "title": "Arrived dinged up. Not happy.", "text": "It\u2019s pretty, but it\u2019s not very sturdy. Mine arrived looking like it had been dropped on its edges either before or during transit tho I suppose it could have happened in a warehouse somewhere.  Even if I was willing to overlook that- which I am most definitely not- I opened it up to see that the tabbed monthly pages were all bent and folded too.  They are just regular paper pages with a little tan at the top that has a protective tape over it to make it sturdier i guess. Clearly it does not make it stuffy enough to survive the shipping.  I briefly thought that I would keep it & try to make it work bc returns are such a hassle for me bc I am disabled.  I get really annoyed with having to watch out for porch pirates trying to steal my returns if I put them on my porch to wait for UPS.  I am both physically disabled & hearing impaired so I have 2 service dogs, but I have found that if I try to keep my returns inside my home until UPS arrives they either don\u2019t ring my doorbell to alert my service dogs who then alert me or they leave before I can physically get myself to the door. So yeah- returns are a big deal to me. Lol.  Bc if miss the window for UPS to pick it up (they only try once now) I then have to take it to a drop off center. Did I mention I am disabled? Lol. And I don\u2019t drive?  Yeah. Big time fun at my house with returns.  So then I would have to pay more for a taxi there & back than what the products are worth. Lol. Not to mention my pain & suffering throughout all of it.

I\u2019m disabled & I am trying to find new ways to keep my mind off chronic pain which can consume a lot of brain cells.  Sadly, I took a disastrous fall shortly after buying it bc my neighbor blamed my bird feeders for injuring a local squirrel that likes to raid my bird feeders even though I left food for the squirrels too. The exact same food. I kid you not, but the evil little bigger decided to get on a light branch I was advised to place the feeder on by a bird conservancy place that \u201cshould keep the squirrels off of it\u201d. Ha!  The squirrel was limping from a fall. I went out & stood on a 36\u201d crate & took a nasty fall & I now have to have another back surgery. Proof that no good deed goes unpunished as the saying goes. Lol.  The fall lead to a concussion & repeated blackouts & exacerbated sciatica & massive swelling on my head, face, butt, elbows, hips, knees, etc. lol. Literally everywhere that hit the ground when I fell. So the irony is I have not even been able to use my beautiful bird journal to record any bird sightings since I bought it bc I am laid up awaiting back surgery. The last one left me disabled 15 years ago. Anyone reading this please keep me (Sherri) & my family in ur prayers bc if my past surgery is anything to go by i & we will need it.

This one is a gem!  I absolutely love it!  I am stunned that my art easel actually fits it & even better two of the plastic legs nicely fit into the book ledge groove to keep it nice & steady while I draw & paint.  I love the ski sled legs because it makes it so easy to move when I have to get up. One of the previous types I tried was so heavy I could barely lift it due to my disabilities, but this is sturdy & light.  The only thing I might do is add 2 pieces of small rubber to the ski sled legs at the ends by my body for added stability so that it doesn\u2019t move when I don\u2019t want it to because I suffer with vertigo & sleep apnea & I don\u2019t want it to move if I fall over. Lol. So I would still be able to just lightly lift the legs w the rubber attached & still be able to push it forward easily enough. The only other thing I miss & need is a cup holder as I am on medications & need to stay hydrated & do lots of arts & crafts where I need to have water handy. I understand they probably didn\u2019t add it bc most ppl buy it to use as a laptop table & electronics & fluids are never a hood idea, but I wish I had the option to choose for myself. I\u2019ve thought about drilling a hole in the top & adding a cup holder or more likely just adding one to the side. As I will likely add some cup holders for my pens, pencils, & brushes, & craft supplies. I also wish that they offered an even larger size.  For those of us who are stuck in our beds & literally live in them there are very few options that are not homemade.  I would love one to go the full length of my queen bed & have designed several of them. Lol. As I live alone with 2 service dogs there\u2019s nobody to complain about me dropping beads in the bed or spiking paint on the sheets. Lol.  To the manufacturers: bravo on a well-designed product & please for the love of God & this disabled woman please make a larger option!!!!  Mine never leaves my bed. I just push it to the end of the bed & go to sleep & wake up the next morning & pull it back towards me & resume my crafting or bills or whatever I was doing the night before. Lol.

My first thought on opening the box was &#34;wow, this is huge&#34;. It's longer than my previous clipboard, so I wasn't sure how I would like toting it around at work (I'm an RN). However, the difference has been like trading up from a rickshaw to a Caddy. Not that there is anything wrong with a rickshaw!<br /><br />My new clipboard fits everything but the kitchen sink (see attached pic). I wear my stethoscope, but can store it in the clipboard when I leave work, so I don't forget it at home and then have to wear one of those plastic yellow isolation-cart throwaway ones that don't work for poop. My pockets are usually BUSTING at the seams with all the stuff I like to carry around. No longer! I can cram it all inside this beast! I don't know how well it will hold up to my dropping it repeatedly, so I will post an update in a while with the durability factor.<br /><br />P.S. I am one of those endlessly-researching people who look up reviews online for 7,456 items before deciding on one. You're welcome. I've done all the legwork for you. :-)<br /><br />**Update, December 2016: This case is still perfect! No cracks, the top clip is still tightly secured, still feels really sturdy. :)<br /><br />**Update, after dropping the case a few times over the years, a piece of the plastic broke.

On the down side, he told me the sizes he was able to use were not optimal, as his charts were intended to be larger and this product would not support them (so he had to readjust his copies to be smaller so he could laminate them). He also brought up the noise of the unit (which I see was mentioned here in another review). He couldn't understand why the unit was so noisy as the general unit that the school provides for free is far quieter and little to no vibration. Overall, this is a relatively inexpensive device if you really need a portable laminator. However, for larger needs or if you operate in an office where noise may be an issue, this is not for you.

We shall see how it goes.  I have high hopes.  I did purchase one additional handset because we needed 2, but not 3 and it was still cheaper than purchasing the plug in boxes (that didn't have super great recent reviews). I believe you can purchase up to 12 (?) additional receivers if you need them with this unit - but I am not certain.  The base unit is a corded phone - and the screen is large and easy to read.  You can sit on a desk, or hang on a wall.  The two cordless units have fairly large screens too - pretty easy to use with nice large numbers - however, they do NOT like to stay in their charging units - a slight nudge and the fall over.  Eh.  I am really just hoping for less spam calls. We rarely use the landline -but where we live it is necessary to get the DSL we need - so any calls coming to the landline are 99.9% spam.  Says you can block up to 1000 numbers.  That seems like a miracle after just 10.  Fingers crossed.  Having said all of this, I never hesitate to update my reviews should new info seem useful.<br />UPDATE:  4/6/2021... So after a few weeks...I have to say that all of sudden - it' s the sweet sound of silence.  I have literally not had a single call of any kind, let alone SPAM (which is actually the only calls I get on my landline) I did activate the option to have callers \"announced\" (caller must say their name and be announced before call goes through) - maybe that's it.. but whatever it is - I am very much appreciating the huge reduction of spam calls.  I haven't had to push the \"call block\" button once.  In all honesty, we keep the landline only because it's the only way we can get the DSL we do - as crappy as it is.  In a very small rural area, we sadly have little choice.  So a system like this - stopping the long lists of SPAM calls is real relief. I do wish the system was a bit easier to use - it's a bit complicated - thus I still stand on the 4 star review.  If you have reasonable ability to read a bit of lengthy and boring instructions, you can get through it.  And if you're overwhelmed with SPAM calls, I would definitely recommend it.  I will continue to update if new info would be helpful.", "images": [], "asin": "B07D2BHBYR", "parent_asin": "B093D138QF", "user_id": "AFZUK3MTBIBEDQOPAK3OATUOUKLA", "timestamp": 1616716204095, "helpful_vote": 16, "verified_purchase": true}

This order contains 6 pieces, 3 in each bag. You can buy individually as well.  The new, updated style is a lot better designed and offers much, much stronger magnets.  I have worn these on a lot of different material tops, thick, thin, smooth, silky, thermal, sweatshirts.. and all with secure success.  I have tried the leash type of reader holders but I hate the string around my neck - plus your glasses dangle over what your working on - or become like a bib when eating.  I am a woman so placing the magnet holder in the right spot is a consideration but I have found the perfect spot for me.  If you haven't tried this version, I encourage you to try them.  This particular style has TWO strong magnets, one on each end.  They do offer this version with sparkly dots and in gold tones if you prefer.  I wanted just a simple, plain version (I already have some cutesy versions) and these are definitely plain and simple - great for every day use.  I have found the magnets are so strong you use them on scarves and other neck treatments if you'd like.  I have even used on a thin wool ruana - worked perfectly to hold the ruana in place all day.

{"rating": 4.0, "title": "coin counter", "text": "UPDATE BELOW....I ordered this just to keep track of the loose change in my bowl.  It is a fully plastic item and lightweight... but if it were any heavier you wouldn't be able to lift it when full of coins.  The plastic bottle, while lightweight, appears to be pretty sturdy. Time will tell.  The pics I have included show around $45.00 in change so I estimate the jar will hold around $200+ in change if I keep around the same mix of coins shown....It will obviously depend on what coins you are dropping in. There are two &#34;pinches&#34; on the side of jar, but they are pretty useless unless the jar is empty.  When it has change in the jar, it's too heavy for the side pinches to be useful.  The opening of the jar is about 2 1/2&#34; .  And adult cannot put a hand inside the jar, so you will have to pour the contents out.  The jar is about 10 or so inches tall... eye balling it.  The top (counter part) requires 2 AAA batteries (not included) AND a tiny screwdriver  to open the battery compartment.  Upon opening and inserting batteries, I put in a counted number of coins.. $1.67 for a test.  The lid immediately failed after 3 coins and just stopped adding or reading denominations at all. I read the directions and inserted a pen into the &#34;reset&#34; hole on the underside of the lid (to the top right area of the battery compartment).  It reset and I tried again.  It worked.  And continued working through the rest of the coin drops.  The screen read stays on a few minutes (haven't timed it yet) and then blacks out.  It re-awakens when you drop another coin in.  With each coin dropped the screen flashed the denomination of the coin 3x and then shows the total.  Normally I just throw my coins into a big bowl.  When it gets full I load up into a ziplock and take it to my bank.  Back in the day they wanted the coin rolled... now, no bank will take rolled coins.  Thus the ziplock bag.  The counter will take some of the guess work out of the total.. IF it continues to work... but I am ok with a &#34;close&#34; total. It's amazing how fast it adds up. I am disappointed it failed right out of the gate. PLUS.  I HATE it when you have to use a tiny screwdriver to get into the battery compartment!!  I never hesitate to update my reviews should new info seem useful.<br />UPDATE 2/14/2017.... the seller contacted me immediately and offered a replacement top, stating that the top should not have failed even with a restart.  Currently the original top is still working.  I will keep the second as a back up.  It is rare to come in contact with such a responsible seller.  I added one star to the rating for this response and hope the jar will keep working.

{"rating": 5.0, "title": "Easy set up, great price, very versatile and effective", "text": "Wanted a multi-function that would work wirelessly for the several computers and smart phones at home. Setting up the the printer on WiFi was a snap. It recognized the SSID right away and I just had to enter the password. Every computer and smart phone then recognized the printer wirelessly right away. We've tested by printing from two computers and one phone. Flawless!<br /><br />The scan function works great as does the document feeder, which is really helpful for scans as you do not have to take the time to place your document(s) directly on the platen, or remove it (them). The little LCD screen is really easy to use for scanning, which is quick and of good quality. The color touch screen is bright and the icons are easy to read and easy to use.<br /><br />The print and scan quality are excellent. I didn't need it to be top of the line quality, but it sure is close. The print is a little light, but other users have said that this makes the MFC870 easy on ink use.<br /><br />For under $100, this little multifunction is a super deal. It is by far the best ink-jet I've ever owned and the well-designed multifunction capabilities make it the most versatile too.<br /><br />The 100-count paper tray is I suppose a bit of a downside. But, if you only print 100 pages every couple of weeks like we do, it's hardly noticeable.<br /><br />This is the first Brother printer I've ever owned.

{"rating": 4.0, "title": "Wi-Fi Setup is Tricky, Control Panel a little difficult to get used to; otherwise a great printer", "text": "Unpacking and doing the basic printer set up and filling with ink was pretty easy.  The instruction sheet is clear and easy to understand and follow.  This printer is different than any other I have had in that it doesn't use ink cartridges, but instead uses ink tanks.  You fill each tank with the appropriate color of ink from a bottle (bottles are included to fill each color tank fully).  You can actually see the ink levels from a semi-clear window on each tank; you also can view levels from software.  Print quality seems decent with good colors.  I liked the fact that the printer is not overly large or heavy.  It has a reasonable footprint for the capability it has.  Now the negatives.  First of all, since there are tanks with ink in them, if you tip up the printer much when moving it, you could potentially spill ink out.  The tanks have covers, but not sure how secure they are; there is an obvious warning on the box not to tilt the printer after the tanks are filled.  If you wanted to ship the printer, you would have to find a way to drain the tanks.  The control panel on the printer is a little confusing until you get used to it.  I kept wanting to press the LCD display, but it is not touch screen.  You use buttons to the right of the screen to navigate.  To make a photo copy is a number of presses on the panel.  Even turning the printer off is a three step process.  Another brand of printer I have is easier to operate.  Another gripe that I have when setting up is that when you are unable to connect from your computer, if you have to end the program, you have to start all over from the beginning with a complete reinstall of software.  The only real negative to this printer is the Wi-Fi setup.  I could not get it to set up properly, until I used a USB cable.  At first I thought the problem was that my router was running at 5GHZ and not broadcasting a 2.5GHZ signal and actually ended up setting up a separate SSID for dedicated 2.5GHZ.  That did not work at all.  Finally by using the original SSID of my router, was able to connect my computer to the printer with WiFi, but ONLY by using a USB connection for the setup (USB cable is not included).  After you connect, you can remove the USB cable and then print with WiFi.  This printer only works on 2.5 GHZ and I think it is time that manufacturers start supporting 5 GHZ on their devices.  If you want to use this with WiFi, you better know a lot about your router.  Fortunately you can use the printer on a network (Ethernet cable), a USB connection or wireless.  Scanning is a little hard to figure out because you have to download and install a separate utility from the Epson website and it is not quite clear what it is that you download and install; fortunately I guessed correctly, as I got scanning to work from my computer; however, I could not get scanning to work from the printer panel.  A label on the top of the printer mentions FAX capability, but the outside box does not and apparently a different model does faxing.  As far as how long the ink lasts, I am not optimistic as the black ink has already gone down quite a bit and I have only printed about a half dozen pages.  I think once you get over the oddities of setup, this is a good printer.  A little weak on setup.  Nothing included to set it up; you have to download from the Epson website.  That's probably a good thing as you always have the most up-to-date software that way.", "images": [], "asin": "B07NK8PM4D", "parent_asin": "B07NK8PM4D", "user_id": "AFAIJYOUO3NAWLBDIKTQSC3DASWA", "timestamp": 1563402802126, "helpful_vote": 4, "verified_purchase": false}

I removed both together and then tried to insert a toner cartridge, which of course didn't fit.  Then I realized that it was a two part assembly and got the Arthur cartridge inserted and within just a few minutes it was printing perfectly.  I am assuming that the color cartridges will work just as well, but it will be some time before the colors run out.  I was confused by one reviewer who wrote about a cartridge drying up.  Since toner is a dry powder to begin with, I didn't understand this.  I didn't give these 5-stars because I don't know how long they will last.

Sometimes the tape didn't seem to stick as well as I would hope, but just pressing down with a finger took care of that problem.  Was able to write on the tape without any difficulty.  I seem to recall using other brands in the past that were better overall; however, more expensive.

{"rating": 5.0, "title": "Does everything I need; very heavy, but not a large footprint; fast; quiet", "text": "I am giving this 5-stars with some reservations.  First of, the cons.  The printer is very heavy and I had a hard time getting it out of the box; almost pulled a muscle.  Also had a hard time lifting it up on the table where it will sit.  I am 70 and I can just barely handle 40 pounds of weight; this weighs in at approximately 50 pounds.  If you can't handle 50 pounds and don't have help to lift and place it, don't get this printer.  The other concern I have is how long the toner cartridges might last and I have seen some say they have had problems with the printer reporting toner out before it is, but apparently there are ways to get full use of the cartridges before they are truly out, so it may not be a big deal.  When toner does run out, you'll end up spending about $70 a cartridge, so a replacement of all 4 (3 color and 1 black) will cost you between $200 and $300 depending on where you get the cartridges from.  What I recommend is that if you don't do a lot of color printing, just by a monochrome laser printer and supplement it with a cheap color ink jet.  Of course you have to consider whether or not you have room for two printers and also the cost of ink jet cartridges, which are not cheap either.  Now lets cover the good stuff and why I rated this 5-stars.  The printer is very fast and quiet.  It shoots out black & white pages very rapidly.  Of course color pages take a little longer, which you would expect, but are still reasonably fast.  Color print quality doesn't seem quite as good as some printers from other top printer manufacturers (such as EPSON and Canon), but it is adequate if your color printing requirements are not too precise.  Another thing I really like about Brother printers is that they include a FAX function.  Fax is a feature not as much needed these days, but there are times when it is needed and convenient.  Try to find a non-Brother printer with fax capability; I doubt you will.  The software install went easily and it wasn't too difficult to set up for wireless use.  You can use either USB or wireless.  The software is easy to use, but I did have difficulty trying to configure the printer to scan from the printer panel instead of the computer.  The scanning software on the computer is easy to use and it is easy to figure out how to scan letter or legal (or other sizes) and also not difficult to print on legal size.  For legal printing you do have to open a door on the front and feed the sheets in.  There is no paper tray for legal size, so this is not the ideal printer for printing lots of legal sized pages.  My older monochrome Brother laser could also handle legal scans and printing, but very complicated and difficult to set up.  It is fairly easy with this printer.  Overall, so far, I find this printer to be a big improvement over previous laser printers I have owned.  If I run into any problems later, I will update this review.  Note: I did not try the duplex scan, which seems like a good feature to have.", "images": [], "asin": "B07FMS1JSS", "parent_asin": "B0B1F8WN5H", "user_id": "AFAIJYOUO3NAWLBDIKTQSC3DASWA", "timestamp": 1535657196772, "helpful_vote": 1, "verified_purchase": false}

Shredders are noisy in general, but this one is reasonably quiet.  It has the added feature of a slot for CD/DVD shredding and you can also shred plastic credit cards.  I didn't try shredding 12 sheets that it is supposed to handle.  I noticed that most shredders work a lot better if you don't try to use them at full capacity.  This does seem powerful enough to do 12 pages at once, if you want to do that.  Amazingly this comes with a complete 12 page manual, explaining the features of the shredder, maintenance, trouble shooting and warnings. There is also a separate one page troubleshooting guide.  These days manuals are a rarity, so I think that is a real plus.  Well designed machine.  So what's not to like?  Even though this is a crosscut shredder the pieces are a little bigger than with my prior shredder. It still does an adequate job of shredding, but would have liked to see smaller pieces.  Also, the waste bin is a little small and will require emptying more often than my previous shredder that has a much larger bin.  Overall, this is a great medium duty shredder and I like it a lot.", "images": [], "asin": "B0714PJR6F", "parent_asin": "B0714PJR6F", "user_id": "AFAIJYOUO3NAWLBDIKTQSC3DASWA", "timestamp": 1514752429362, "helpful_vote": 6, "verified_purchase": false}

I guess the best feature of these is the strip you peel off to stick the envelope shut.  It has a nice sticky strip that holds well and doesn't look like it would dry out any time soon.

You have to fold a standard sheet of paper in half to get it to fit in these envelopes.  The package of 250 seems like a lifetime supply for me, as I wouldn't use very many of this size.

{"rating": 3.0, "title": "Decent printer, but can be difficult to set up.  Ink is too expensive.", "text": "Stylish and attractive with a somewhat small footprint and reasonably quiet operation.  It is not really fast printing, but adequate.  Printing starts right away, which was not the case with one printer that I own that takes forever to start printing.  Making a copy is very easy; just put your page face down on the glass and press the copy button.  Unfortunately, there is no sheet feeder for copying or scanning multiple pages, so it is a page at a time.  If you do a lot of page scanning or copying, you need a printer with a sheet feeder, but you will pay a lot more for that convenience.  There is no button on the printer panel to use to scan a document; you have to use software for that.  The driver for the printer, scanning software and manual must be downloaded from a website given in the instructions.  It makes some sense to me not to have the software included, as these things change over time and having it online ensures you get the latest version when you install but that does make a little more difficult for the novice.  Also until you download and check the user's guide, you really don't have a clue on how to scan.  The software installs a program simply called &#34;scanning&#34; on your Windows PC and you run that to scan.  One of the first things I did not like about this printer is that there are only two ink cartridges; one for black and one for color.  I have never liked that because if you run out of just one color, you have to replace the whole color cartridge.  The printer has an &#34;ECO&#34; button you can press that puts out less ink to help you save on ink when you don't need the very best quality, so that's something that can help save on ink.  The ink is a very pricey, so not sure this would be as economical as printers that have 4 or more ink cartridges  This only has color and black and the cartridges shipped with the printer did not last very long..  If you want to use this on USB, rather than wireless, a USB cable is not included, so if you don't have a spare around, you have to buy one.  After you download the software, you have to run it and apparently connect a USB cable initially, even if you are going to use it wireless.  You are given a choice in the install as to whether you want to go wireless or with USB.  On one computer I had trouble with either option; it kept telling me to attach a USB cable that was already attached.  I investigated and found out that the printer was showing up in Windows and I could use it with USB.  As far as wireless, there are two options; either with a WPS button or manual where you enter your router information.  On one computer, neither option worked, even after multiple attempts; I could not get wireless to work at all.  I tried connecting the printer to another computer and both the USB option and the manual setup for wireless worked perfectly on the first try.  I could not get the WPS option to work, even on the second computer.  Since the manual setup worked, I didn't need to.  (If you don't know, WPS is a button you press on your router and then you press a button on the printer within two minutes and it is supposed to connect automatically).  Was going to contact support about the wireless problem, but since I got it working with manual settings on one computer, I didn't call.  If you are not somewhat computer literate, this is not the best printer for you to try to set up; you might struggle with it for a while.  This printer also is supposed to be able to scan remotely with your smartphone with a free app that you can download from the app store, but I did not test that capability, as it seemed to me to be of limited value.", "images": [], "asin": "B071FK6NVP", "parent_asin": "B071FK6NVP", "user_id": "AFAIJYOUO3NAWLBDIKTQSC3DASWA", "timestamp": 1499299132308, "helpful_vote": 1, "verified_purchase": false}

Also, the picture makes it look like one end is narrower than the other.  It's not; it is equal width on both ends.  Easy and fast to assemble.  Comes in three pieces; base, pedestal and top.  Just insert the pedestal into the base and push all the way down.  Then put the top on and push down until it locks in place.  Genius design.  It is ready to use in 10 minutes or less.  Seems quite sturdy and well made, but it supposedly only holds 15 pounds, which is not much.  Has a nice big easy to use lever underneath to raise or lower the desk to the exact height you want.  It goes up high enough to use as a standing desk or low enough to use as a work table.  It might not work quite as well as a computer desk if you are seated, as it is a couple inches too high at the lowest setting; at least for me it was.  It works good as a work table, which is probably how I am going to use it, with thoughts of maybe later using it as a standing desk.  The main problem with this &#34;desk&#34; is that it just isn't quite large enough.  It would be ideal for a laptop, but you couldn't put a desktop computer plus monitor, keyboard and mouse on it; it would be crowded.  Also with the weight limitation of 15 pounds, it probably is too much weight for it to hold.  It works well for a monitor, keyboard, mouse and a little space on the side for paperwork that you might be typing from and not much else.  Your desktop computer needs to be elsewhere on the floor below it, probably.  The desk is not easy to move, as there are no wheels on it.  I knocked off one star on my review for the weight limitation and the price.  This is not a $500 desk.  I think maybe $200-$300 would be a more appropriate price.  Of course you get what you pay for and the base and pedistal are all metal and the top does appear to be solid wood and not pressboard.  For the price though, locking wheels would have been nice, as well as a little larger size and ability to hold more weight.

{"rating": 4.0, "title": "Wonderful Printer, But Has a Few Flaws", "text": "Have had this printer for several years and have been quite satisfied with it.  The color quality of the printing is outstanding.  I have a newer quality printer by another top manufacturer and the colors are not nearly as vibrant as they are with the R300.  Epson apparently makes some of the best inks.  I use standard 20 lb. paper in it and get good quality.  Photo paper gives better quality of course, but heavier paper does jam easier in this printer.<br /><br />There have been a lot of complaints about the amount of ink this printer uses, but it may be a misconception.  It warns you of low ink long before you have to really replace the cartridge.  You can sometimes print many, many pages before the ink actually runs out.  Ignore the low ink warning and just wait until it stops printing and says the ink is actually out.  One problem with low ink is that you sometimes cannot do an ink head cleaning if ink is too low.<br /><br />Once in a while I have had banding problems when printing.  Just run the printer through a cleaning cycle or two and problem goes away.<br /><br />The only design flaw I have found in my printer is that the CD/DVD printer tray seems to have an issue with feeding in sometimes and quite often I have to give it a little nudge to get it started.  Also it sometimes doesn't eject all the way and I have to pull it out. Initially the tray worked fine, so it could be a component that has worn enough to cause the problem.  It has been doing it for a long time, but I can live with this slight problem, as the print quality of the CDs and DVDs is excellent and I have printed 100's.<br /><br />Would hate to pay the prices now being asked for this printer ($300+ and up), as I think I bought mine new for around $100.  I must have gotten an incredible buy or the prices on this have jumped dramatically.<br /><br />When the printer quits, I think it will be well worth repairing.

{"rating": 4.0, "title": "Gorgeous Printer; Time Consuming to Set Up", "text": "This is my first wireless printer and the setup for wireless connection was not too difficult, except that my firewall interfered with being able to connect, so had to shut it off temporarily.  If you plan to use this in wireless mode be sure that 1) You already have a wireless router and 2) You know the pass phrase for your router.  You have to enter the pass phrase into the printer and it is very time-consuming, but at least you only do it once.  You can use the printer with a USB cable if you don't want to set it up for wireless. The software installation on the PC was very time consuming too.  It took probably close to 20 minutes or more. This is the first printer that I have had where I had to install the print head myself.  The print head (not much more than a tray to hold the ink cartridges) is not difficult to install, but it took me a few tries to figure out how it went in.  Finally when I got it tilted just right, it slipped right into place.  This is a gorgeous looking printer with a sleek black color and a flip up LED panel with a clear bright display.  Menus are easy to understand and obvious.  I didn't get confused or stuck on any settings.  I am a little concerned about the small size of the ink cartridges, wondering how long before they run out.  There are six cartridges, so they may last a while, since printing a color page would only use a little from each one.  The printing seems fast compared to my older printers.  Initial settings do not print the best quality, so if you want good color printing on plain paper, you have to make a change to \"high quality\" instead of the default \"regular\" quality.  The first pages I printed in regular quality were a little disappointing, but the high quality ones came out great, obviously using more ink. There are two paper trays; one for plain paper and one for photo paper.  Photo printing with photo paper produces excellent quality prints.  Another big plus to this printer is that it comes with plenty of really good documentation, so if you read the manual and follow the easy step-by-step instructions, you'll have it set up with no difficulty.  It may take a while.  Took me well over an hour from the time of unpacking, until I printed my first page from the computer, although some of that time was messing with my pass phrase until I entered it correctly.  If you are an impatient type of person who doesn't want to read instructions, this is probably not the printer for you.

{"rating": 3.0, "title": "Definitely some pros and cons", "text": "This envelope making board has its pros and cons. I had purchased the original gray design with white lettering about 4 years ago. Although the print is small, I could read it without any issue at all. Then when I spotted the new pretty blue and white punch board I thought why not. I<br />use my old one so much that I thought it would be nice to have a much prettier one, ong with a new punch blade to justify my senseless purchase. Big mistake! The pretty new design is extremely difficult to read the tiny print. The background color is blue with white font. I never struggle to read anything, but I do with this.<br />My suggestion is that if you are also having an issue reading yours, just print the measurements out on a piece of paper to store away with the board.<br />The other issue I have is that when making the larger envelopes, the board itself is not large enough to accommodate your paper. And I mean for envelopes only like 4x6 or larger. The paper hangs off the board so you can\u2019t score the entire paper. I have made 100+ envelopes of all sizes so it can be done regardless, but sometimes my score lines are off a bit because of this and I end up with a crooked envelope that can\u2019t be fixed. So I end up having to throw the wonky envelope one in my scrap pile for another project.<br />PROS: Despite all mentioned above, I still find this method far easier that cutting everything by hand, which I did for years before the board.<br />Initially I thought there was something wrong with the design because all my envelopes came out wrong. I watched a YouTube video and got the hang of it after making 3-4 envelopes and now it\u2019s a breeze and the process is very fast.<br />My 3 star review is because the new color combination is hard to read for some. And another star dinged because this really needs to be on a larger board platform. Us crafters spend our $ like crazy on our hobby, so why not make a larger version for $10 more. I sure would buy it! Don\u2019t take the reviews seriously that say it<br />doesn\u2019t work. They just don\u2019t have patience and the willingness to learn something new.

I cant do anything about tvs, video player hook ups though. When I got this, I thought it would be one of the hard ones because you have to sinc up your iphone with it..ahhh..but actually, if you follow the simple directions it was easy. Yes I did have an issue connecting the two but it was a matter of being patient. I figured it would be difficult to use to print from the phone...boy was I wrong! After you install the hp socket app, you just click on it and your pictures are there. ...helpful hint, it might take a minute or two the first time you sink the two for the pictures to appear on your phone screen...just be patient, it does work. After that they come up very quickly. The unit is nice and small (fits in a shoe box even with cords)  and was packed very well. It comes with 10 picture papers and 1 ink cartridge. The ink is a nice small unit that pops right in! When you have your picture that you are ready to print, you just click on the printer icon that comes up under the picture...one word of caution here... only hit it ONCE!  This is when your patience is a virtue lol. I hit it once, then waited...nothing happened...hit it again..still nothing, hmm then the on light began to flash ( the pic info was coming thru) and the picture began its printing cycle. It prints one color comes out and is sucked back in for another color. It does this 4times, then the picture comes out, drops on the tray and is done! Easy peasy! Until the second picture began to print because remb, I hit the button twice lol because I didnt wait...I didnt know then, but now I do. The second time I printed a picture I hit the print icon and waited..the picture began its cycle. After all this I can honestly say this is the easiest gadget to set up and use! Since it didnt come with much paper, I ordered more. I compared prices on 4 different sites/stores and they were exactly the same as Amazon, 34.99 for 80 picture papers and 2 ink cartridges...Im guessing 1 cartridge for every 40 pictures...makes each pic cost 43.73 cents per picture, which is a bit more than printing in stores but I think those machines are harder to use so to me, this is def. worth the money. I just started to check on some features on the app for adding to pictures. There are happy birthday banners you can add to the picture before it prints and a lace one, pumpkins etc. It also has holiday things to add too! I bet there are so many more features in the app to enhance the photos that I will find as I get better using it!

{"rating": 1.0, "title": "A never ending sales pitch and mismanaged basic features, disguised as a printer", "text": "I wish that useability was a feature that I could rate separately. Any printer can manage a quality piece of paper so I'm not sure that's a feature I need to rate separately in 2020. The fact is they never stop trying to force Instant Ink on you at every turn is something I'd like to rate. Where is the option to rate how often they shove their subscription service down your throat?<br /><br />You also cannot actually start any features from the printer directly but you have to go back to where the app is. What this means is you cannot scan things to a location...even though it's connected to the computer via WI-FI. The scan button just tells you it will not work and you need to use the app (why include the button then??)  So if you have multiple pages to scan on to your computer you must go to the printer, put the item in the scanner, go back to your computer and initiate the scan, wait for the scan to complete, return back to the printer to add another page. Or you can scan to your phone and then share the documents from your phone to your computer. There is no option to have the printer save a device or file location making this the most inconvenient scanning experience I've had in the past decade. There isn't a multi-page option either. You have to return the computer and let the app know there is another page to be scanned. Selecting scan on the printer using the touchscreen will not just send this next page to the correct place<br /><br />There is an option to add the smart task app to your printer app (requires an email and password). Smart Task is for...I'm not sure. It allows you to create favorite save locations...provided they are attached to a company that paid to have them listed as storage locations like Dropbox, One Drive, and Evernote. There is no \"Smart\" option that leads back to your own computer. An option to email the files to a place automatically with the subject line prefilled with \"You've got HP Smart app files\" though. There was plenty of thought put into THAT during development. There also isn't an option to smartly scan multiple documents. So again, HP has found a way to try and profit multiple times from your purchase of this printer, this time through selling this space inside their Smart Task app to file storage companies rather than making a functional product. I guess I do know what Smart Task is for actually. Ha.<br /><br />Also, while the touchscreen functions all operations must be handled through the apps HP makes you download sooo........1 star for a feature that is made redundant by their insistence that all functions ONLY initialize from the application.", "images": [], "asin": "B0799D4T89", "parent_asin": "B0799D4T89", "user_id": "AE427MY65PZ6FNZ2IY6HCTIIQZEQ", "timestamp": 1595006874968, "helpful_vote": 5, "verified_purchase": true}

{"rating": 4.0, "title": "Excellent Printing!", "text": "One of my biggest gripes with printers, is that the ink replacement costs are high. With my previous printer, an Epson Workforce, it cost about $80 to replace the ink and I would have to replace it at least twice a year. Because of that, I was very excited to give this printer a try. If I can go two years or even close to two years without replacing the ink, then I will be a happy person. The ink for this printer comes in bottles. The bottles are poured into the tanks. I found this to be pretty easy with minimal mess. The ink doesn't automatically start pouring out when you turn it upside down, but once it's attached to the tank, it starts flowing. The only ink that ended up on my hands was from peeling the spill cover off of the bottle after removing the lid. I ALWAYS get inky hands when doing any type of project with paints, inks, etc, so I was very surprised at how neat this process was. The print heads did require installation. This gave my husband a little trouble because it's dark and not easy to get to. Once I held up a flashlight for him, he was able to snap them into place right away. I was actually happy to see that the paper tray/holder was in the back of the printer! On my previous printer, it was located in the front. I tend to spread my work out all on my desk and when the printer would run out of paper, I would have to pick up everything just to open the darn paper tray. I personally think that this a great feature! The print quality is wonderful! I'm very impressed with how nice the photos come out. The printer noise level is fairly comparable to other printers. Though I've found it making noise at odd times. This morning, it started making noises like it was going to print out something. My husband and I were sitting in the living room at the time and he asked me if I was printing out something. I told him that I assumed he was, but he had not. So unless the cats were printing out things, we're unsure why it was making noises. We hadn't used it since the previous afternoon. Overall, I do like it. Only time will tell whether or not it lives up to the 2 years without replacing the ink claim. One last thing, I haven't been able to find the ink refills for purchase yet. I'm curious to see what those cost and if they're easy to find. I know it's a brand new printer and technically, if the ink does last for 2 years, I don't need to buy any just yet!", "images": [], "asin": "B07XGNLFJC", "parent_asin": "B07XGNLFJC", "user_id": "AHV6QCNBJNSGLATP56JAWJ3C4G2A", "timestamp": 1579102538961, "helpful_vote": 1, "verified_purchase": false}

This pen had no hesitation or interruption of ink at all which was very impressive. I was also surprised that the ink doesn't smear, at least on the paper I have been using so far. I'm sure a non-porous paper would smear, but I've been running my finger over my writings and there have been no smears at all. The pen comes in a fancy box, ready for gifting. It really is a gift worthy pen if there's such a thing. I do think it's pretty pricey, but it is a quality writing tool.", "images": [], "asin": "B015N3Q4JY", "parent_asin": "B015N3Q4JY", "user_id": "AHV6QCNBJNSGLATP56JAWJ3C4G2A", "timestamp": 1506260259157, "helpful_vote": 1, "verified_purchase": false}

I was becoming more organized, but I still had the planner envy thing going on because I didn't have a calendar planner. I looked around at calendar/agendas and couldn't settle on what. I didn't want to add more pages to my Happy Planner because it was already pretty full with all of my non-calendar stuff. Then I saw the Emily Ley Paper calendar. It's just basically, just a calendar. It doesn't duplicate the items I have in my other planner. Each day has its own page which I love! There's plenty of room to put the fun planner stickers and draw colorful doodles with my new markers. There are colorful tabs that separate each month.  I really like the little weekly prep feature on each weekend page. The pages are a nice weight and my markers do not bleed through. The spiral binding is not flimsy at all. It does come with one page of stickers, which won't last very long, but now I can buy some of those other cute planner stickers out there! I am still using the digital calendar.

My Samsung Galaxy J7 fits in one of the phone slots, even with the case on. There's plenty of room for my wireless mouse on the designated pad. My mouse moves pretty easily on the felt-like pad. I didn't realize how warm my laptop is when it's resting on my lap until I got this. There was an immediate difference in the temperature. It went from warm to cool instantly. The slats allow air to flow and circulate and keep the laptop from overheating.

I was able to use it by myself which says a lot. Often, I have to rely on my husband's expertise on things like this. You put a stack of bills into the machine and it gives you the total number of bills. This is going to save a lot of time! When I used to be on the school PTA board, we would have to count money from various events. I can't tell you how many times I would have to restart because I lost my place. We always had to double count (two different volunteers) so if the numbers didn't match up, we would start over. Here, you just find out how many bills you have of a particular denomination, then you calculate the value of those bills. This also detects counterfeit bills, though I am not sure how it does that. Every time I tested some bills in the machine, I hand counted them to make sure that it was accurate and it was.  Extra parts are provided which is nice.

It is convenient and I like that I have it all in one book. In the gradebook there are 50 rows to a page.  At first I didn't like this but with my smaller classes I found that i can skip a line between students allowing me to make more notations.  The rows are also shaded every two rows (2 rows white, 2 rows green) which makes it easier to distinguish entries.  Another nice feature is a 6th column at the end of each week. I use it to record daily vocab study on the website we use. The book itself is pretty sturdy and is holding up to the abuse of daily use and transport in my laptop bag. The gradebook pages are perforated at the outside edge which is typical of these books and is useful when you switch marking periods. The perforation is too close.  The pages tear easily when you flip pages.

I usually love Amazon but in this case Newegg was much better.  In sum, you really can't find a better combination of features and quality for the price.  The only real complaint I have is that sometimes documents fed through the automatic document feeder aren't 100 percent straight (more like 98 percent straight, but this is only a problem sometimes).<br /><br />PROS:  Auto-duplexing for input and output; 35-page document feeder; great quality when using high print settings; good speed at all settings (unless it's 2-sided); two paper inputs allows you to keep two different papers in the printer at all times, or to just close the top feed if you want; fast and high quality faxing with lots of features (fax isn't just an afterthought in this machine); multiple ink tanks means no disposing of partially full ink cartridges; very good driver software gives you lots of printing options through your computer; many copy, fax and scan options built into the machine and accessible through nice rotating LCD screen; no paper jams yet (UPDATED: Still no jams after over three months of continuous use!).<br /><br />CONS:  It's BIG, as in seriously big and heavy too; like I said above, about one-third of the time documents fed through the document feeder are just the slightest bit off; duplex printing is slow because it stops for ten seconds to let the ink dry on one side before printing the other side; text printed at low quality can be fuzzy, definitely use high print quality for important documents; it's a little on the noisy side and even has a \"quiet mode\" that I haven't tried yet; after two weeks of use I had to run the \"unclog nozzle\" routine to make some black streaking go away (I realize that maintenance is needed sometimes but after just two weeks seems a bit soon); would be nice if it came with a USB cable; photo printing gobbles up ink.<br /><br />Overall so far I'm quite satisfied, though if the document feeder issue gets worse before the one year warranty expires I'll send it to Canon for service.  And if need be I can always place documents on the glass by hand.  Without that issue I'd give it 5 stars.<br /><br />(Note, after 13 months of use this printer fell off a table and stopped working.

However, it staples cleanly (without bending or distorting the staple) only about 25% of the time.  (And of course it\u2019s quite difficult to remove a bent staple that\u2019s gone through 180-plus sheets of paper.)<br /><br />To some extent, the staples are to blame.  The stapler comes with a box of 5/16\u201d staples (the maximum length).  These may not be as sharp as they need to be, to staple big blocks of paper.  Better quality staples will probably improve the stapler\u2019s performance.<br /><br />The stapler seems to give the best results when the handle is pressed down with a slow, steady pressure.  The staples load through an opening at the rear.  You pull on the black plastic that is located just below the screws on the handle--the black plastic is attached to a spring-loaded rod that pushes the staples forward as they\u2019re used.<br /><br />The staple-pusher mechanism seems a bit flimsy.  It\u2019s impossible to say whether this will stand up to regular use.  The rest of the stapler is quite sturdy in its construction.<br /><br />The stapler has a chart attached to the base that tells you which size staples you need for your stapling job, depending on how many sheets you need to staple.

{"rating": 1.0, "title": "Costly \u201cPrinter Stand\u201d With Highly Misleading Ad Photos", "text": "One star for this IPARTS EXPERT DESKTOP PRINTER STAND (with 4 Rolling Wheels), because of the highly misleading advertising photos on the Amazon product page.  This is NOT a wheeled printer stand that you place on the floor next to a desk.  Instead, it is a small DESKTOP ORGANIZER STAND with wheels.  It is very expensive (about $46 on Amazon) for something you place atop a desk to hold a very small printer and make space underneath.<br /><br />By adding wheels to this desktop organizer, the seller can photograph it in a way that makes it look like furniture--like a full-size printer stand.  In the product page photo, the \u201cplant\u201d alongside the organizer is actually a bunch of flowers in a vase of water.  It gives you no idea of the actual size of the organizer.<br /><br />The price is also in line with the price of a budget-priced printer stand.  (Yes, the product page text cautions you to measure your printer before ordering, but that doesn\u2019t excuse the intentionally misleading photos.)<br /><br />The wheels help create the deception in the photos.  Why would anyone want wheels on a DESKTOP organizer?  Few desktops have space for rolling anything around, let alone a heavy item like a printer.  Should the wheels go past the edge of the desk, they will tip the printer onto the floor.  (This is a real possibility, because the wheel locks do NOT prevent the stand from rolling on a smooth surface.)<br /><br />ASSEMBLY.  The organizer stand comes with an alternate set of pads that you can use instead of the wheels.  It is easy to assemble, using the included Allen wrench, until you come to the wheels.  (On my stand, the holes for the screws were drilled correctly and the screws went in straight.)<br /><br />The wheels screw into the holes in the metal parts, but you need a slender wrench of the correct size (not included) to accomplish this.  The pads can be screwed in by hand.  My assembly instructions consisted of a single letter-sized page which said nothing about how to add either the pads or wheels.  (I\u2019d suggest putting the wheels with the locks at the front, where you can reach the locks.)<br /><br />PRINTER SIZE.  The organizer will hold an EPSON WF-2530 all-in-one printer, which is advertised as the Epson Workforce printer with the smallest footprint.  The organizer is hopelessly too small for my larger Epson and Canon printers, which are the ones heavy enough to benefit from placement on a wheeled printer stand.<br /><br />See my photos to get some idea of the size of the stand.  The letter-sized assembly instructions are shown atop the wooden parts.  The big Quaker Oats box (42 oz.) is included for scale.  The large hardcover cookbook pretty much covers the lower shelf; the book only fits when laid on its side.", "images": [{"small_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61yAbjXep3L._SL256_.jpg", "medium_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61yAbjXep3L._SL800_.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61yAbjXep3L.jpg", "attachment_type": "IMAGE"}, {"small_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71bi3JFVIJL._SL256_.jpg", "medium_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71bi3JFVIJL._SL800_.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71bi3JFVIJL._SL1600_.jpg", "attachment_type": "IMAGE"}, {"small_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/814OAYdbwTL._SL256_.jpg", "medium_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/814OAYdbwTL._SL800_.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/814OAYdbwTL.jpg", "attachment_type": "IMAGE"}, {"small_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81YY45gG7cL._SL256_.jpg", "medium_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81YY45gG7cL._SL800_.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81YY45gG7cL.jpg", "attachment_type": "IMAGE"}], "asin": "B083NJ7LQM", "parent_asin": "B083NJ7LQM", "user_id": "AEYGPUCRKH7G4VM22FM3VAKSQ23Q", "timestamp": 1591040996625, "helpful_vote": 1, "verified_purchase": false}
{"rating": 4.0, "title": "Slow, But Good for Shredding Junk Mail; Has Tiny Footprint", "text": "There are many different AmazonBasics shredders, but what distinguishes this AMAZONBASICS 12-SHEET CROSS-CUT JUNK MAIL, CD, AND CREDIT CARD SHREDDER (with Pullout Basket) is the tiny footprint.  The shredder is only 12\u201d wide and 9-1/2\u201d deep, so it easily fits on top of a low bookshelf, credenza, or filing cabinet.  It can even fit on a desktop, if you\u2019re a \u201cclean desk\u201d type who doesn\u2019t need much desktop workspace.<br /><br />The small size comes at a cost, though.  The junk-mail shredder is much slower than my wonderful [[ASIN:B00D7H8XB6 AmazonBasics 12-Sheet High-Security Micro-Cut Shredder]]; and the small pull-out basket fills up very, very quickly.  The basket is fairly easy to empty into a large wastebasket; but if you overfill it, you\u2019ll have lots of shredded paper bits to clean up.<br /><br />The cross-cut blades cut the paper into strips that are 3/16\u201d wide and 1\u201d long, which offers pretty good protection from snoops.  However, my micro-cut shredder makes strips that are 3/16\u201d wide and 5/8\u201d long, which offers much more security.<br /><br />The manual doesn\u2019t say how long you can run this junk-mail shredder before it will turn off and require a 45-minute cooldown.  Probably it will run for several minutes.  In my experience, if you pause frequently between batches of documents, you will never encounter the need for a long cooldown.<br /><br />I ordered this shredder because I wanted a small shredder dedicated to junk mail, and it fills this need perfectly.  However, I won\u2019t be using it for large batches of documents, because it\u2019s too slow.

The Tombow dispenser has made me a convert to glue tape.  Glue tape is far superior to the inexpensive glue sticks I've been using for attaching  labels to letters and filing folders.  Glue tape goes on smoothly, in a thin layer, precisely where I want it, and presumably won't dry out like the clumsy glue sticks.<br /><br />The dispenser has a plastic flap that flips down when you want to glue something; the flap flips up to protect the glue side of the tape when the dispenser is stored in a drawer, box, purse, or carryall.  The used tape rolls up automatically inside the tape cartridge.  A switch on the back of the dispenser opens and closes for cartridge replacement and secure, locked-in cartridge replacement.<br /><br />The pre-installed Tombow cartridge seems to contain a substantial amount of tape, so the dispenser shouldn't need constant refilling.  The replacement cartridges (Tombow Mono Permanent Adhesive Refills, 3 Pack (62207)), currently about $7 on Amazon) are fairly inexpensive.<br /><br />However, the Tombow &#34;permanent bond&#34; adhesive does NOT provide a permanent bond.  I tested the bond by gluing two standard Post-It notes together.  The bond certainly was stronger than the weak, removable bond of a Post-It (and is probably much stronger than the bond of Tombow removable adhesive).  However, the two Post-Its peeled apart easily, with no tearing of the paper, in multiple tests--even in a test where I pressed on the paper for a maximum bond, and waited 15 minutes.  (The adhesive is not supposed to require drying time.)<br /><br />The &#34;permanent bond&#34; is probably strong enough to hold photos and papers in albums and scrapbooks.  Because the adhesive is advertised as &#34;acid free&#34;, it's probably a good choice for those purposes.<br /><br />However, the &#34;permanent bond&#34; is not nearly as strong as Elmer's glue.

It just cuts the CDs into big pieces.<br /><br />The Sentinel shredder doesn't feel quite as sturdy as the AmazonBasics shredder.  The two shredders make about the same amount of noise.  The AmazonBasics shredder is a little faster.  The Sentinel shredder has a larger bin (7.7 gallons as against 6.6 gallons).  Both shredders have forward and reverse switches for clearing jams.  The Sentinel shredder has a light that comes on when the bin is full.  Both shredders handle a maximum 12 sheets at once; both can shred staples, although both user manuals recommend against shredding staples, paperclips, or anything with adhesive, if you want to prolong the shredder's life.<br /><br />My true workhorse shredder is an old Fellowes PS-14C crosscut model (no longer sold) that handles 14 sheets at once.

{"rating": 4.0, "title": "Accurate Electronic Scale; AccuPost Software Could Be Better", "text": "This  ACCUPOST PP-110 DESKTOP POSTAL SCALE with USB cable and 10-lb. load capacity weighs in 1/8-oz. increments, and seems to be quite accurate for its entire range.  I tested it with letters weighing less than half an ounce or only a few ounces, and compared the weights to those registered by an [[ASIN:B002UEZ2FC Ozeri Professional Digital Kitchen Food Scale]].  Both scales gave the same results.  (This scale replaces my old Pelouze 5-lb. mechanical spring scale, which weighed in 1/2-oz. increments, and wasn't at all accurate for lightweight letters.)<br /><br />I also tested this scale with two 5-lb. bags of sugar, which weighed a total of 10 lbs. 1-1/4 oz.  The results were generally consistent, although a single bag sometimes registered at 5 lbs. 3/4 oz. (instead of 5 lbs. 5/8 oz.)--probably because the extra packaging weight was very close to 3/4 oz.  This scale also weighs in grams and kilograms.<br /><br />I was a little disappointed to learn that the software doesn't automatically calculate the postage that needs to be added to the letter or package.  (I was hoping for software that would let me download postage rate changes to my computer, and then would compute postage amounts automatically whenever I weighed something.)  Instead, you must (1) visit the appropriate USPS, UPS, or FedEx web site, (2) find the appropriate page for calculating postage or shipping, and (3) paste in the weight.  If you're using the MSIE browser, the software will send the weight directly to the calculation page (no pasting required), but this is probably not worth the effort of plugging in the USB cable and getting the weight to display on your computer screen.<br /><br />The software was hard to find--the link in the user's manual didn't work, and the download link on the AccuPost home page didn't work for Windows 7.  Eventually I found a working download link on the AccuPost 10 lb. scale product page in the AccuPost Online Store.  The Win7 software requires Microsoft NET Framework 4, a free download.  The software itself is a bit glitchy (doesn't always respond if it's been open for a while), but it usually works okay to show and paste in weights, handle the \"tare\" and \"hold\" buttons, and turn the scale on and off.<br /><br />The scale comes with a power adapter, which is great to have if you do a lot of mailing.  Since I don't, I opted to use 3 AA batteries (not included) to power the scale.  The software works with either the power adaptor or the battery option (unplug the power adaptor first).  Because my postal scale is located on a table some 6-8 feet from my computer, I used an [[ASIN:B001TH7GUU AmazonBasics USB Extension Cable]] to successfully supplement the included 40-inch USB cable.<br /><br />The \"tare\" feature works flawlessly:  you can add an item, such as an empty container, then hit \"tare\" to return the weight to zero so that you can put something in the container to find its weight separately.  The \"hold\" feature allows you to hold the weight display when you are weighing something large that overlaps the display--you hit the button and wait for the two beeps, then when you remove the large item the weight will still be showing.  The extra-large numbers in the display are another excellent feature.<br /><br />I like this electronic postal scale a lot, and find that it does everything that's reasonably expected of a postal scale.

{"rating": 4.0, "title": "100% Jam Proof Feature Works Too Well!", "text": "You'd better believe the product description for this FELLOWS POWERSHRED 73Ci 100% JAM PROOF 12-SHEET CROSS-CUT SHREDDER.  The shredder is indeed 100% jam proof, and it will accept 12 sheets, tops.  In fact, these are the features that I like the least.<br /><br />This shredder has a sensor with a lighted display that shows Red (too many sheets inserted), Yellow (productivity is optimized), or Green (more sheets can be inserted).  If the sensor starts with Red, the shredder won't start.  If you insert flat sheets of paper, it will shred them quickly (though it will sometimes accept only 11 sheets).  With ordinary paper loads, the shredder will run continuously for 10 minutes of shredding.<br /><br />However, if you insert unopened junk mail--which usually has lightweight card stock and paper inserts, in addition to regular letter paper--the shredder will start, but will halt with an overload soon after it begins to shred.  (Presumably the sensor sees the load differently once the layers are separated a little.)  This isn't really a problem, because the shredder will reverse and advance, reverse and advance, until it clears the jam all by itself.  However, the jam-proof feature slows the shredding process, because the shredder doesn't operate continuously.  (I'll admit that I'm hard on shredders, because I find it entertaining to try to get the maximum load in each shredder pass, and to try to get the shredding done in the shortest possible time.)<br /><br />A nice feature of this FELLOWES 73Ci shredder is that it has both an on-off switch (at the back), and a lighted \"on\" panel (at the front).  You must touch the front panel to instantly light the display and start the shredder.  After 2 minutes of nonoperation, the lighted display automatically goes to sleep mode, which shuts down the shredder.  This display feature, along with the 12-sheet sensor that prevents needless paper jams, saves on energy.  Other nice features are the display lights that show when the bin is full or open, and the shredder's \"SafeSense\" technology that halts the shredder when hands touch the paper opening.<br /><br />However, all of these electronic sensors and jam-clearing features come at a price:  the powered shredder \"lid\" that fits on top of the bin support is very heavy.  It is much heavier than the \"lid\" on my older 18-sheet Fellowes PS-14Cs cross-cut shredder, which also has the \"SafeSense\" technology (but not the sheet sensor or the sleep mode).  The two shredders cut identically-sized pieces that measure 1/4\" by 1-1/2\".  I actually like the older model better, because of the greater sheet capacity that makes shredding junk mail a breeze.<br /><br />The FELLOWES 73Ci shredder's weight is offset by the fact that the bin (and \"lid\") support is equipped with casters.  Casters mean that the shredder is easily moved, and easy to shift around when the bin needs emptying.  The shredder blades are easy to maintain, needing only a little oil after each binful, squirted across the shredder opening.<br /><br />This is actually my fifth Fellowes shredder.  I broke the first two, purchased many years ago when shredders first appeared in the office supply chain stores (e.g., Home Depot, Staples).  I overloaded and jammed them, and ruined the motors.  My third Fellowes shredder, a strip-cut model, performed admirably for many years--despite my continuing overload abuse.  It was finally replaced with this cross-cut shredder.  I donated the strip-cut shredder to Goodwill, and I hope it will continue to shred away for someone else who finds strip-cut shredding adequate.  My fourth Fellowes shredder, the 18-sheet cross-cut shredder already mentioned, is still in use in my home office, after 3-4 years of operation and some overload abuse.<br /><br />Because the FELLOWS POWERSHRED 79Ci 100% JAM PROOF 12-SHEET shredder won't operate continuously when I shred unopened junk mail, I give it only 4 stars (\"I like it\" on the official Amazon scale).  If you have light shredding needs, then this shredder is a great choice, because a cross-cut shredder gives good security, and is cheaper to buy and maintain than a diamond-cut shredder.  If you have moderate shredding needs, then you should probably consider a Fellowes shredder with a larger sheet capacity, such as the [[ASIN:B000YGO7HW Fellowes 3229901 PowerShred 99Ci 17 Sheet Cross-Cut Shredder]] (slightly more expensive, with many similar features including jam-proof technology, but lacking the energy-saving feature).", "images": [], "asin": "B0092KZ94G", "parent_asin": "B07FB61N5R", "user_id": "AEYGPUCRKH7G4VM22FM3VAKSQ23Q", "timestamp": 1367030666000, "helpful_vote": 42, "verified_purchase": false}

I purchased a box, which cost about a dollar more than a box of my usual Swingline S.F.4 chisel point staples.  Both boxes appeared to be about the same size, although the Optima box has 3750 staples, and the S.F.4 box has 5000 staples.<br /><br />The Optima staples do seem to be jam free, but stapling with them requires a lot more effort than stapling with S.F.4 staples.  Probably the Optima staples are stuck together with special glue that prevents jamming, but doesn't want to let go. I used the Optima staples in a [[ASIN:B00006XY3P Swingline Compact Commercial Stapler (S7071101R)]], which is a terrific little desktop stapler.  Maybe the Optima staples take less stapling effort when they're used in a larger stapler specifically designed for Optima staples.<br /><br />For the future, I'm definitely sticking with the [[ASIN:B003RL7RRS Swingline S.F. 4 Premium Chisel Point Staples]].

It was also very temperamental when trying to connect to wifi the first time. I'll need to go into my settings, but it also seems like the default is to shut off while not in use, then requiring that I &#34;register&#34; my paper type every single time I use the printer. Despite all this, I got this printer in the hopes it would do one thing that many other mid-level printers do not: seamlessly print on 110 lb cardstock. And I'm happy to say this printer is a CHAMP at doing that, using the rear paper feed. I use 110 lb cardstock often for my craft business, and economy & mid-level printers typically chew it up getting caught on the rollers.

{"rating": 4.0, "title": "Could be more user-friendly, but still a solid, versatile machine.", "text": "The printer comes boxed very carefully, and has a number of little safeguards in the machine that need to be removed before use. Getting the machine plugged in, all the parts moving, etc, was simple enough, and I thought the ink process was particularly interesting. The screen guides you through inserting each cartridge, with a carousel-type of thing that forwards to each slot for the different colors of ink. It took another 10 minutes for the machine to clean the printer heads, align the ink, etc, which seemed a bit excessive. Will it do that each time I change the ink?<br /><br />Getting the printer to work wirelessly with our computers was a little more complicated, and required the disk on both PCs. The disc installs the machine as both a scanner *and* a printer, with software to control the settings of the scanner function. Although it took some time, the printer is now working well on the network with our computers. Printing is fast and the quality looks good. The copier works as expected. The scanner has a few options for output - scan to PC, scan to email, scan to USB, etc. I've been working through all of them, and while they are great features, I will say it's not nearly as intuitive as my HP Envy printer. It's just a clunkier process, though still useful.<br /><br />The machine itself is larger than most, but still reasonable for desk-top use. The ink is affordable to replace, which is good, since we have four kids in school who will be using it often for papers and such. It'll take me forever to remember it's not a touch screen, but I'll survive. (but honestly - why not a touch screen??)

Perhaps I am just the wrong customer for this kind of printer - we need it primarily for home office use, but it seems perhaps more suited for a small business.

{"rating": 3.0, "title": "Good Gel Pens! But doesn't dethrone the champ", "text": "My go-to gel pen is the Sarasa Clip 0.7 Retractable. It's the gold standard for me. So naturally, I was excited to see how they compare. And they compare pretty well. Both pens write very smoothly and unless you are a very discerning user of pens, you probably wouldn't notice the difference in a blind test.<br /><br />I'll discuss some of the differences between these and the Sarasa pens below. Overall, my critiques are minor.<br /><br />First, it's the construction of the pen. These pens feel less polished--a little cheaper. The barrel is larger and not tapered anywhere, and the shirt clip feels like a solid block of plastic, whereas the Sarasa has a bit of a taper and is more molded. Next, it\u2019s the smoothness of the pen. While both these and the Sarasa are very smooth, when you use them back-to-back (as I did to test these), the Sarasa is noticeably smoother. Also, the black ink in these pens fades a little and doesn't stay as black as the Sarasas.", "images": [{"small_image_url": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71Q4K+fhk7L._SL256_.jpg", "medium_image_url": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71Q4K+fhk7L._SL800_.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71Q4K+fhk7L._SL1600_.jpg", "attachment_type": "IMAGE"}], "asin": "B0B6MT4C5V", "parent_asin": "B0B6MNK3MK", "user_id": "AHUPTBY3F3UN2S5H7K5JLP6MAV5Q", "timestamp": 1668063612255, "helpful_vote": 0, "verified_purchase": false}

Although this says it is a postal scale, it is really for packages because it does not register letters.

It is just a plastic cover with a small lip that keeps the shavings from spilling out. Instead, once I pry it off, the pencil shavings go all over the place. That is a terrible design.

{"rating": 3.0, "title": "Vintage-looking journal with a few \"dirty\" pages and cheaply dyed leather; nice design", "text": "I ordered their [[ASIN:B07PZVN2WN tree journal]] and was not happy with it. However, this journal is cleaner and the paper whiter. It is vintage-looking but not too dirty and worn that it offends my senses.<br /><br />As is typical of a leather-bound journal, the paper is not replaceable. Writing on the paper with pen or pencil works well.  A few pages have smudges on them and I did see some thread or lint between some pages. The underside of the leather is poorly dyed looking as if it is dirty and does appear to have fingerprints dyed in the back of the journal. I do not care for those fingerprints. The tie is just a string of leather and not set in a way that makes it intuitive to tie the book shut. The embossing on the outside is very attractive, however.<br /><br />There are five sections that are \"stitched\" into the book. Each section has a centerfold string.<br /><br />The six photos show the following in order:<br /><br />1 - The attractive stitching on the binding and the outer leather embossing.<br /><br />2 - The front of the journal.<br /><br />3 - The back of the journal.<br /><br />4 - The blotchy spots found on some pages pages.<br /><br />5 - The  front inside leather cover and blotchy dye work.<br /><br />6 - The back inside leather cover and blotchy dye work with fingerprint stains.<br /><br />In summary, they succeeded in making this look dirty vintage and handmade from scrap. The exterior embossing of a dragon design is super attractive and so is the binder stitching. The leather is cheap and the paper is sometimes blotchy with occasional pieces of lint.

{"rating": 3.0, "title": "Easy Assembly, Cheap Price, Not a Permanent Solution", "text": "I received a 6 pack of boxes which are really 6 individual and deep file drawers.  Each box is assembled with 3 separate pieces of cardboard with the instructions on the back of the file drawer.  Also included is one metal square rod to reinforce each of the 6 file drawer casings.  In addition, there are 12 plastic rails; 2 rails slip onto each file drawer for use in storing hanging files.<br /><br />PROS:<br />- Easy assembly<br />- Boxes can be used for hanging files with supplied plastic rails<br />- Somewhat sturdy considering that they are just boxes<br />- Can be used for more than just files; for instance I would use these as cheaper and much sturdier versions of moving boxes whose only drawback would be that they might be somewhat awkward to carry but are very easy to open and close.<br /><br />CONS:<br />- The 6-pack is actually 6 individual and separate file drawers<br />- The box says that the drawers can stack 5 high with the interlocking clips (which are not included and which I assume must be purchased separately)<br />- The file drawer part has a \"Panel A\" piece that says to detach for additional support but there are no instructions on how to use it.  I guessed on how to install this piece but I can't be sure if I correctly used it to reinforce the handle located in the back of the file drawer.<br />- In order to reduce the shifting of the file boxes during use, I had to put it against a wall. Although it still shifted without the interlocking clips, it worked effectively enough as file storage.<br /><br />In summary, I would only consider purchasing these boxes as temporary file storage or as very basic moving boxes that are cheaper (at the current price of $20.57 for 6) than regular moving boxes. Without the interlockinig clips, I would stack these boxes 5 high ONLY if set against a corner and back wall where they are supported on two sides by the walls and on the third side by some furniture.<br /><br />I do not consider these boxes sturdy enough to use for permanent file storage where the files are frequently accessed.

However, if being utilized by a student daily then, it may pose an issue with longevity and its ability to hold up through a semester. Paper inside is also of a thinner material. You know the type.. it\u2019s paper! It works- but, harder to erase any markings and not crinkle while doing so! (Almost a recycled thinner feel..?)<br /><br />Spiral wire does feel sturdy enough and ends are clipped and tucked in to avoid catching or undoing. These come in a set and all vary in color so, easy and helpful to assign a specific color to a class subject. Priced at $22 for the set of 6- this is a respectable deal.

This scanner is so light, I am surprised.

{"rating": 3.0, "title": "Hard To Use", "text": "I'm a planner junky. This planner has some good parts, but some glaring flaws. The good first:<br />I like the amount of space in each day. You have two columns on a page. You can either plan for two people (or split your work and personal planning in a side by side manner) for 12 hours (beginning at 7). OR you could plan out the entire 24 hours, using one column for day hours and the other for night hours. Each daily page has a small calendar at a glance at the top of the page for the current month, previous month, and next month. The days are numbered with the current day of the year and how many days are left in the year (3/363, 151/214, 289/76, etc.) This does contain the entire year. The last pages is a three year at a glance calendar. It does list holidays on the pages. It does lay completely flat when open.<br />Now, the glaring problems. There are no tabs, so finding a given month to jot something on the calendar isn't quick. Sundays do not get a full day. The bottom of Saturday is cut short at 11 hours instead of 12 hour and you get 4 blank lines for Sunday. If you have busy weekends, this may not work at all. (Which is pretty much where I found myself.) There are no transitions between months. No monthly calendar at all. There is only a tiny space (2 lines) to write non- time specific items. You could put washi tape over all the times and just write in whatever you want. My other issue is the inconsistency in the start of the year and end of the year. The calendar starts on January 1st. Which is a Tuesday. No Sunday and Monday for that week is included. You just start your new calendar on Tuesday. But it doesn't end the same way. You would think if they chose to stick to only 2019, the calendar would also end on a Tuesday, December 31st, right? Nope. It ends on January 3rd, which is a Friday. It didn't even finish that week. Just added three extra days at random.

{"rating": 2.0, "title": "Poorly Planned", "text": "I am a planner lover. This planner is such a let down. I\u2019ll walk you through it, but this is not ever a planner I would recommend.<br />This is a premade planner that is undated. All the pages have a set function, but you fill in the dates for yourself. The cover is hardback with a leatherlike feel. It has three bookmarks sewn into the binding. It is bigger than a standard size bullet journal, but more narrow than an Erin Condren style planner.<br />The elastic band to hold the planner shut is far too tight. It is very difficult to get it around the planner brand new. As my planners fill up, they bulk up. This elastic has no hope of being at all useful for long. And it really is difficult to get it around the planner.<br />The cover of the planner is marked. It has a tree and says \u201cproductivity planner\u201d. I would like the cover blank or with just the tree.<br />Each section of the planner (monthly, weekly, and daily) is in its own section. It is not lined up with the month, weeks, and days together for the month. You\u2019ll have three separate places in the planner to flip. This isn\u2019t a problem for me, I actually set my bullet journal up in a similar way.<br />There are twelve monthly spreads, 2 pages per month. A typical monthly calendar layout with weeks beginning on Sunday. There is a side bar for notes. Across the bottom of each month, you have 4 boxes with numbered entries. There are 5 numbered lines for : goals, priorities, accomplishments, and knowledge gained. You could put washi tape over the headers and make these fit your life better.<br />Then you reach the weekly section. Only 23 weekly spreads. Not sure how that math works out. The weekly spreads have specific boxes on a two page spread. You have room for 5 successes and 5 improvements each week. A small box with new skills to acquire. A small box to focus on. You have a very specific list of plans for your week: about me, work, family &amp; friends, and relationship. Then you have five project boxes to fill in. And five goals for the week.<br />Then you get to your daily pages. No, there are not enough for the entire year. There are enough (plus a couple extra) for those 23 weeks if you only fill them out Monday to Friday. Each two page daily spread has a  schedule for the day where you write in the time and task. There is a small space for a daily to-donlist and a small box where you write in why today is special. So specific. You also list your top five priorities of the day, your affirmations, and what you are grateful for.<br />At the end you have a few pages of mind maps and vision boards. This planner is so specific, while leaving you to fill in the dates. I feel like it is trying to be the Passion Planner, but it isn\u2019t the Passion Planner. It is also poorly planned. Either give me 52 weekly spreads OR 365 daily spreads. Don\u2019t give me an inadequate number of both.<br />The paper is fine. A little on the thin side for a planner, so ghosting and bleed through can definitely be a problem.", "images": [{"small_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71+sE7Z7c0L._SL256_.jpg", "medium_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71+sE7Z7c0L._SL800_.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71+sE7Z7c0L.jpg", "attachment_type": "IMAGE"}, {"small_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/717Y6Sb1U6L._SL256_.jpg", "medium_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/717Y6Sb1U6L._SL800_.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/717Y6Sb1U6L.jpg", "attachment_type": "IMAGE"}, {"small_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71EPFSJIEtL._SL256_.jpg", "medium_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71EPFSJIEtL._SL800_.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71EPFSJIEtL.jpg", "attachment_type": "IMAGE"}, {"small_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71T1uG5mfhL._SL256_.jpg", "medium_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71T1uG5mfhL._SL800_.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71T1uG5mfhL.jpg", "attachment_type": "IMAGE"}, {"small_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71ZS1aa31TL._SL256_.jpg", "medium_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71ZS1aa31TL._SL800_.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71ZS1aa31TL.jpg", "attachment_type": "IMAGE"}, {"small_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71oRsL4XpgL._SL256_.jpg", "medium_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71oRsL4XpgL._SL800_.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71oRsL4XpgL.jpg", "attachment_type": "IMAGE"}], "asin": "B07B7VNDMM", "parent_asin": "B07B7VNDMM", "user_id": "AEICZD35OTDYVWA2KPYWN4PDZ2SA", "timestamp": 1527022778961, "helpful_vote": 0, "verified_purchase": false}

{"rating": 4.0, "title": "It Works", "text": "This pencil sharpener isn't impressive or fancy. It is a very simple electric sharpener. It sharpens pencils (and the instructions are very clear that it ONLY sharpens pencils. No crayons, chalk, or anything other than a pencil.)<br /><br />It takes about 20 pencils sharpened to fill the shavings chamber. Definitely not for classroom or high usage.<br /><br />The automatic stop function isn't really an automatic stop. It says the change in the motor will let you know it is done. It only does this on standard #2 pencils. If you're sharpening something with softer lead or colored pencils, it will just go and go and go- eating your pencil. So don't wait for the motor change on anything but a #2. It also sharpens really rough on some pencils and super smooth on others. It was super smooth when sharpening Smencils (pencils that smell made out of layers of recycled paper) but ridiculously rough on Crayola colored pencils. (But decently smooth on Crazy Art colored pencils.)<br /><br />It is pretty loud. It also moves. The little gripper feet on the bottom do nothing to hold it in place. You still need to place your free hand on the sharpener to hold it in place while sharpening. You also have to grip the pencil being sharpened pretty tightly so it doesn't spin in the sharpener.<br /><br />After sharpening about 50 pencils, it started squeaking slightly when you remove the pencil and the motor is stopping.<br /><br />It makes teeny tiny little shavings that are obnoxious to clean up and have a tendency to \"stick\" to the end of the pencil, so you are constantly dealing with lead dust on the pencil end. Sharpens pencils to a finer point than I prefer (but all X-Acto sharpeners have done this for me). It is just a personal preference thing, though.<br /><br />WIth the \"energy efficient DC adaptor\", I though, for whatever reason, that the adaptor was optional and the sharpener could be run on batteries. It can't. It just plugs in.<br /><br />If you just need an occasional use pencil only sharpener, this will meet you needs. If you use a pencil sharpener a lot, this one won't make you very happy.<br /><br />Edited!: My toddler shoved a crayon into the pencil sharpener. Which is usually the death of a sharpener. However, I was able to push the crayon through and basically sharpen the whole thing down to remove it and the sharpener is still going!

{"rating": 3.0, "title": "Interesting Sharpener", "text": "[[VIDEOID:7d5c66cd01f1c0feb0aac3ed8627bc20]] As you can hear, the sharpener is a bit loud. And as you can see, it takes about 15 seconds to completely sharpen a pencil (from new to sharp). Pencils that are already sharpened to some degree don't take as long. (The \"shh\" \"shh\" sound toward the end of the video isn't the sharpener, it is my 4 year \"shushing\" himself because I was making a video.)<br /><br />You just feed the pencil into the sharpener and it takes care of the rest. You are supposed to take your hands off the pencil, which my kids find difficult to remember. (Even if they do like to watch the \"magic sharpener.\") As you can see in the video, the pencil is ejected when it is finished sharpening.<br /><br />The tray for the shavings is tiny. Less than 10 pencils and it is full. That is a bit annoying. If you let it get over full you'll have 2 problems to deal with. (1) The pencils will have little wooden bits left on them. (2) The tray will be extremely difficult to remove and will create quite the mess.<br /><br />It sharpens pencils to a pretty severe point. (I happen to prefer a smaller point, but that is just personal preference.)<br /><br />I was able to sharpen regular wood hexagon pencils, wooden round pencils, wooden round pencils with plastic coating, wood round pencils with glitter coating, colored pencils, and smencils (made of recycled newspaper) without any problems.

I was able to sharpen 50 pencils and the tray still wasn't full! I like the automatic stop, though the motor doesn't stop, it just stops sharpening. That feature keeps kids from being able to feed their entire pencil through the sharpener. It is a pretty deep sharpener, so once pencils get short, they can't be put in this sharpener anymore. I've sharpened colored pencils, regular hexagon shaped pencils, novelty pencils, glitter pencils, and fabric pencils and have not had the sharpener jam up once. It has sharpened every kind of pencil with the same ease and the same results. I wouldn't say this motor is quiet. No, it doesn't sound like a helicopter landing, but it isn't quiet.

I have had good fortune with the brand, and I like the variety of colors. I also like the fact that they're retractable. I had high hopes for these and they mostly have met my expectations, though there's room for a little improvement.<br /><br />There are 36 pens in the box I received and there's a good variety of colors. Each came with a little rubber plug over the tip to keep the pen from drying out, and that's a good thing. When using these, I put the plug right back in when I'm done, though I am not so sure how much that helps.<br /><br />The clicker works as expected on each and this has one very specific benefit for me - I like that I can lay the pen down and not worry about it staining anything on which it sits. I have had other felt-tip pens stain textiles on multiple occasions from my carelessness, and these pens already help me with that.<br /><br />I have one complaint with these pens. For felt pens, they seem to be quite dry. They do write, and they certainly are not dried out already, but they write like pens that have been 75% used already. Time will tell how long they'll last - I am hoping the drier writing means they will last longer from using less fluid?<br /><br />These are decent art pens with a good variety of colors and thoughtful design.

{"rating": 3.0, "title": "Difficult to Peel", "text": "This is my second pass at this review. I originally wrote this one thinking that these weren\u2019t stickers at all and that what I had received was just paper pictures that required a glue stick to adhere to anything. It turns out that this was incorrect - these are in fact stickers, but they\u2019re difficult to peel. As such I have rewritten this review to be fair.<br /><br />I received a pack of 100 individual stickers, packaged in two separate baggies. These are small and individually cut so they\u2019re not like sheets of stickers you normally buy in a craft store that have a paper backing and are easy to peel. They\u2019re colorful, and each sticker is unique. Most have a Christian message, some even with Scripture references, while some are more targeted toward Catholics in particular and a smaller number are just inspirational.<br /><br />I have two issues with these. First, these are not at all easy to peel. I honestly did not think they were stickers at all because I was unable to peel any of them. My wife was able to peel one with some persistence. Once peeled, they adhere well and they should have no trouble with peeling at the edges, at least for a while. The second issue is the product description. These are listed as vinyl stickers, and I am not so sure that these are actually vinyl. They\u2019re not paper as I originally thought, but I believe they\u2019re very thin plastic. Either way, they\u2019re waterproof.<br /><br />My initial assessment of these was wrong. These are stickers as advertised, but they\u2019re not easy to peel and I am not convinced they\u2019re vinyl as advertised (though that\u2019s a minor point). If you can get past the difficulty in removing the backing, these are decent stickers.", "images": [], "asin": "B0B3T7SX9H", "parent_asin": "B0B3T7SX9H", "user_id": "AFLX66DKF6R3H6OEOC3TIVAYXZIQ", "timestamp": 1661249442817, "helpful_vote": 0, "verified_purchase": false}
{"rating": 4.0, "title": "Decent Pens; Expensive and Video Does Not Match Product", "text": "I have used gel pens for several years and I prefer them because they don\u2019t generally skip or smudge as easily as ink pens (though that\u2019s a generality, not an absolute). I have also worked with Zebra mechanical pencils and have had very good success with them. So, I was pleased to get my hands on a set of these metallic gel pens, thinking they would be equally as good as some of the other gel pen brands I have used. They\u2019re good but I have a couple of comments about them.<br /><br />The pens themselves are fine-point pens which suits me just fine. I prefer fine-tip pens as I usually write small. The gel comes out smooth and less smudgy as expected which is a good thing. They feel decent in my hands though like with most pens I am not used to writing for extended periods of time so I have trouble with fatigue when using them. These are no better comfort-wise than other gel pens I have used but they\u2019re no worse either.<br /><br />The colors are not as vibrant as I had hoped, though the product packaging says these are best on dark paper. On white paper they wash out a bit.<br /><br />The product page here shows a video of someone using highlighters and double-tipped pens, and these do not match the product attached to this listing. This is a posting issue, not a product issue, but it is sufficient to potentially cause some confusion. Be aware that what\u2019s in the video is not what you\u2019re getting.<br /><br />Price-wise, these are mildly expensive. As I write this, the $18 price tag works out to $2/pen which is a little steep when considering unit pricing.<br /><br />I do like these pens, though there are marketing issues that I think take away from an otherwise good product. These are good and I can recommend them based on experience; however, pay attention to the unit pricing and be aware that the video here does not match the product.", "images": [], "asin": "B09QJJNJG7", "parent_asin": "B09QJJNJG7", "user_id": "AFLX66DKF6R3H6OEOC3TIVAYXZIQ", "timestamp": 1654363267368, "helpful_vote": 0, "verified_purchase": false}
{"rating": 3.0, "title": "Lower-End Quality, Not Ideal for All Uses", "text": "I selected these cards for labeling packing boxes, an ongoing task in my house. My wife was excited to work with these and so far she likes them though I see some issues with the quality.<br /><br />I'll get right to the point on these - these are not the highest quality cards. If you are working with markers or pens that saturate the paper when you write, these will allow bleed-through. The card stock used is not the best quality and is not thick or sturdy so if you need cards that have some heft or are sturdy, these will definitely disappoint.

{"rating": 3.0, "title": "Monthly Calendar Poorly Designed", "text": "Organization is always a challenge in our house and figuring who is where, at what time, doing what, is a bit of a moving target. We\u2019ve gotten by with writing on a wall calendar but this gets messy quickly, especially when the schedules change. This system of rewriteable boards has helped, but it there is some room for improvement.<br /><br />The most interesting component of this set for us is the monthly planner. It allows for writing out appointments, dates, reminders and other tidbits of information that can be erased and rewritten when no longer relevant. However, there is an issue we found with this calendar right away. The planner has exactly 30 squares for days, the first being on a Sunday and the last being a Monday. So, as I write this, it is January 2022, and the first day of the month is Saturday. Unless we\u2019re willing to erase that day and rewrite the calendar, we will run out of room on January 24. We can add lines to add 5 more days in the notes area, but the first added day is taken up with a big \u201cNOTES:\u201d label that takes away valuable writing space. This was not thought through too well.<br /><br />The shopping list and to-do list are both handy for keeping track of things to pick up before the full grocery list is made and for errands to run/tasks to complete, respectively. They\u2019re smaller than the main calendar and the chore chart, so they have a little more versatility at the expense of writing room.<br /><br />The conversion chart is especially handy for the kitchen.<br /><br />The chore chart is the same size as the calendar and it competes for room on the refrigerator, so a little planning of how to arrange these two is required. This particular chart would have been handy when my kids were younger...<br /><br />This is not a bad set, but the calendar leaves something to be desired. It doesn\u2019t have enough room for a whole month in some cases, and working around this can be a challenge though it is usable.

So far, I have been right, though they have their issues.<br /><br />These are not the typical gel pens you'll find between the check-out in the grocery store. Instead of colorful pens in red, green and blue, these write in gold, silver and white. These are fine colors for things with dark or black backgrounds like labels and some gift cards. I typically don't use these kinds of colors, but then again I have not had access to them.<br /><br />These are fine-point pens, and I think this might be part of the problem that others have seen with them. These have a tendency to start writing and then stop. I don't know if the particulates in the tips jam the ball or if there's something about the gel itself that makes these skip, but it's a definite issue. I have been able to get them writing again, usually by carefully applying a little heat to the tips though this is risky.<br /><br />When they write properly they write very smoothly.<br /><br />These are hit-or-miss pens.

It\u2019s not especially expensive so I didn\u2019t have high expectations, though I did figure it to be up to the task for which we needed it. Though this isn\u2019t a high end cart and there are better choices out there, those choices cost quite a bit more; in it\u2019s price range, this one is just fine.<br /><br />The cart came disassembled as expected. It took about 15 minutes to put together after unboxing, and it required no tools beyond what was in the package. The exact number of parts were included \u2013 no more and no less. When finished, the cart looks exactly like it does in the product listing photos.<br /><br />The cart is very balanced and has no trouble handling a laptop or even working as a small table while packing a suitcase on it (though I do not recommend this in most situations). It is lightweight and I can carry it around one-handed when I want to move it between floors of the house.<br /><br />The downside of this cart is that it doesn\u2019t pull close enough if there is no gap under where you\u2019re seated when working with it. Our couch has maybe a one-inch gap between the floor and the upholstered wood, and as such the cart pulls up close but still far enough away that we have to sit on the edge of the couch seat to use it as a laptop cart.<br /><br />The upshot is that this is a very affordable cart. It sells for $50 as I write this, which is quite reasonable.<br /><br />The vertical adjustment is fairly easy and straightforward. It can be lowered enough to work for a child and tall enough to almost work as a standing desk, and the adjustment takes seconds..<br /><br />I am not unhappy with this cart. It\u2019s a good one and I am getting use out of it already.

It\u2019s a good solution though not perfect, the main issue being the weak magnets.<br /><br />These are brightly colored clips and there are 15 in the set \u2013 and every one of them has a unique color. Though this is a colorful set as such, the colors don\u2019t serve too much purpose other than aesthetic appeal. That is, there\u2019s no way to label these without adding a glob of tape.

There are some really nice features about this board that make is a useful too, but there are also some things about it that could use some more thought.<br /><br />The whole comes requiring assembly. Other than the tools included in the package there is no need for additional tools to assemble the board. Assembly took 15-20 minutes and the instructions were fairly clear and easy to follow. It\u2019s easy enough to put together that I was able to do it without needing assistance.<br /><br />The board has a nice, smooth writing surface without any scratches or damage which is a big plus. Included is a magnetic square that is also suitable for dry erase work, and this is handy when you need to either expand your writing a little or you need to cover up and keep writing. It\u2019s not an expensive thing to add either so it\u2019s a thoughtful inclusion. Also included is a paper flip chart which attaches to the front of the board.<br /><br />All this is well and good but I found a few things that could use some improvement. First, the instructions are not complete. When I was done assembling the board, there was no information on how to attach the flip chart to the front of the board, and though the included clips made it semi-obvious what needed to happen there was no instruction on how to actually attach the clips. I assume I did it right, but I don\u2019t know. Another issue is that the assembly is not completely stable and it does not roll smoothly, especially on carpet though not on hard flooring either. (To be clear, it feels a lot more stable on hard floors, but it is still somewhat top-heavy.) Whenever I move it I feel I have to steady it or it could topple.<br /><br />The last issue I found is more of a design decision. When all put together, the board stands vertical, meaning the long edge is vertical and the short edge is horizontal. There\u2019s no way to rotate the board. I understand that rotating it would mess up the flip chart, but it would be very useful to be able to use the board as wide and short rather than tall and narrow when the flip chart is not attached.<br /><br />This is not a bad board at all and it has some very nice features, but there are some things that could be improved.", "images": [], "asin": "B07W6CQGXQ", "parent_asin": "B07W6CQGXQ", "user_id": "AFLX66DKF6R3H6OEOC3TIVAYXZIQ", "timestamp": 1579517243848, "helpful_vote": 0, "verified_purchase": false}

I will state up front that I have not worked regularly with wooden pencils in years and prefer metal mechanical pencils but I was willing to give them a try. Honestly, I am not a fan.<br /><br />We do have other traditional pencils in the house and I use those only occasionally. Some of them are new, some old, but all feel the same in my hand. These new BIC pencils just feel \u201coff\u201d. I can\u2019t really put my finger on it, but they seem almost slippery and I have to hold them funny to keep a firm grip.

It may be that because I have a hard time gripping these pencils that I can\u2019t hold them firmly enough to write properly?<br /><br />One of the selling points of these pencils is that the leads are hard to break. When I received my pack of 24, all of the pencils in the pack were pre-sharpened, but one of the pencils had no tip. The tip on that one was broken off completely and had settled elsewhere in the package, meaning it probably was not broken when it was packaged. That\u2019s not a good testament to being hard to break.<br /><br />These pencils are all right, but I would not purchase these in favor of cheaper wooden pencils.

{"rating": 3.0, "title": "Damaged Prior to Shipment?", "text": "I bought a nice whiteboard when I was in college to get me through my math and physics classes, and that board served me well long after I graduated - until I got married and my school teacher wife needed it more than I did. I have been wanting a replacement for a while, and this looked like a good one. One very interesting negative about it though - the frame was damaged, though the packing box was not, evidence that the board was damaged before it shipped.<br /><br />This is a big, sturdy board with a heavy aluminum frame and plastic bumpers. it\u2019s a generous 3\u2019x4\u2019 which is larger than what is typically needed in a home environment, though it is approximately the same size as the one I bought in college. However, this one is much thicker and heavier than the old one I bought, and the frame will keep it from warping.<br /><br />On two of the edges there are sliding hanging hooks so that the board can be hung either on a short edge or a long edge and because the hooks slide along the frame there is some versatility in how the board can be mounted on the wall. I like this configuration better than having the hooks attached permanently in the frame at fixed places.<br /><br />The board comes with 12 colorful magnets, 2 magnetic erasers, a small set of markers and a mountable shelf for the markers and erasers. The magnets are bigger than they look in the product description\u2019s pictures, roughly the size of quarters. To be honest, I will not need the magnets at all, though my wife always needs more so they will be used elsewhere.<br /><br />My one complaint with this board - and it\u2019s a serious one - is that the board came out of the box slightly damaged. One of the aluminum frame edges was bent, not in a way that impacts the usability (and not one of the edges with the hooks), but it is noticeable. The board\u2019s frame is damaged, but the packing box was not. This means that the board was damaged when it went into the box. Does it really matter? In my specific case, no, it doesn\u2019t affect me. But, does the severity of damage mitigate shipping anyway? Would you buy a brand-new car off the lot with a noticeably dented door?<br /><br />My rating of this product would have been much higher had the frame not been damaged in such a way that was evident it went into the packing box already damaged.

It seems like an interesting idea on the surface, but the reality is that it\u2019s not all than convenient.<br /><br />The concept is great - write on the pad, upload your drawing to the cloud, then pull it down to other devices so you can work with it everywhere.  The potential is there to bridge between paper note taking and writing on a digital tablet like an iPad. However, the implementation is awkward and not at all ideal.<br /><br />The folio needs to be charged and it comes with a pen that the folio recognizes. This is not at all unexpected. It comes with a pad of paper in it which is good. Tying the package together is an app that needs to be downloaded to an Android or iOS phone (so, if you are a Windows phone user or want to use it with your Windows desktop/laptop, you\u2019re out of luck). I downloaded the app to my iPhone and had no problem tying to the device to the app.<br /><br />My first discovery was a good one (I think). I tried writing on the pad without opening the pen and extending the ball and it would not work until I actually extended the pen so it would actually write. That\u2019s great for use but it makes testing more difficult. It wasn\u2019t made for the testers so there\u2019s not really a reason to complain; this is just a data point.<br /><br />The app tells you when the folio is ready to receive input. I found that I needed to fiddle with the app and the folio before it was ready to receive, and this is counter-intuitive. If the folio is on, it should start to receive as soon as it\u2019s opened, though I understand that the app needs to be running (background should be fine in my opinion). I wasn\u2019t able to get the folio to recognize that I was on a new sheet without twiddling some more and that\u2019s not helpful. Forget to tell it that you\u2019re starting another page and suddenly you have two pages one top of one another in the app.<br /><br />My main complaint is that OCR is not automatic - you get to pay for it separately on a monthly basis. There might be a free trial, but if you have spent that much for a device it should have OCR either included or for a nominal one-time fee ($20-$30 seems reasonable to me). Without OCR - what distinguishes this unit from a phone camera and a regular pad of paper? Other than saving to PDF instead of JPG, not much.<br /><br />This is an expensive unit for what you get and it doesn\u2019t work as smoothly as it could or should.

{"rating": 4.0, "title": "Large Inkjet with Lots of Ink; Best Suited for a Small Office; Pricey", "text": "I have worked with a large number of inkjet printers across several manufacturers and almost all of them have failed me in one way or another. I made the move to a color laser printer for generalized printing last year and the printer I chose was a Brother so I have some familiarity with the brand. I was interested in finding out how this printer would work and how it would integrate with my network. So far, I have had no complaints though admittedly I have not had it long.<br /><br />First off, this is a large printer, the largest inkjet I have ever used. This is not a problem, but it means planning your desk space when finding a place to put this printer. I would recommend using a printer stand just for this printer, where it will not crowd other things on a desk or table. The box in which is ships is huge, and our cats have decided it is a perfect place to sit on top and survey the kingdom...<br /><br />Setup is not hard and I was able to get it on my wifi network and connected within a few minutes. It does come with the software necessary to set it up, but I would recommend getting the drivers and applications directly from the Brother website to ensure having the latest versions unless there is some reason that connecting to the Internet is not feasible. This is not to say that the drivers on the CD are out of date, but the website is much more likely to have the absolute latest versions.<br /><br />This is a multi-function printer that handles printing (in duplex), scanning, faxing and copying. I have not used the fax capability yet though I do occasionally have need to fax documents (it's rare but I do have to do it sometimes). The functions that I use regularly \u2013 printing, scanning and copying \u2013 all work as they should and the printer is fast and efficient.<br /><br />The most important function is printing, and this printer is very efficient, producing good quality black and color images. The printer is fast and quiet, so much so that I had to check on it when I first printed, thinking that it had not printed anything and had only warmed up. I have not yet tried using photo paper in this printer so I have not yet tested the true potential of this printer's ability to produce color prints from high-resolution pictures, but I will shortly.<br /><br />This printer comes with a BUNCH of ink, enough for about 2 years according the manufacturer's estimate. For the average household this is a lot, and likely is more than most need. This amount of ink is better suited for an office setting, though I can see it being useful in a small business or even in a college dorm. For home use, getting the MFCJ6535DW model (no XL on the end) may be more economical. The price difference between the two models (as of April 2017) is approximately $250, and that is a savings over buying the printer and ink separately. Consider which is a better fit for your needs and budget.<br /><br />On the network I have had no issues at all with this printer. Connectivity is good and it seems to respond quickly to print requests. It does go into a sleep mode and when printing to it, it does wake up for printing without requiring intervention (I problem I have seen with some other printers).<br /><br />So far, I have no complaints with this printer. It works very well and it has been stable and responsive on my network. For the home user it is probably a little heavy-handed on the budget though that depends on the need of the household; the model without all the included ink costs half as much and likely would fit a home's needs better. For a small office, though, this is a good printer with good value.<br /><br />As I mentioned above, almost every inkjet I have had has failed me along the way. Time will tell if this one holds up better.

{"rating": 4.0, "title": "Decent Entry Level B/W Laser Printer", "text": "I have a kiddo in college and so far he has had access to a printer when he needs to print assignments so there has been no issue with getting things turned in on time. That said, I have been looking for an inexpensive unit for him, so that should he not otherwise have access he'll have some way to print his assignments when he needs to do so. I was hopeful this unit would be a good fit. It is not a color unit so it is not a perfect fit for the need, but it does work well for my own personal needs. It is a good, entry-level laser printer that handles the basics.<br /><br />In the past I have had good success with HP printers, though it has been some time since I have used one in my home. This printer is another good one though it is not large and it is not as capable as some others I have seen and used. It does a good job of printing black and white pages, it does a nice job of copying and it is a capable scanner. It is not capable of faxing, which admittedly is not a feature I use often though I do have rare occasion to send faxes and on those rare occasions this unit will not help me.<br /><br />Build quality is not particularly good and I am a little concerned that a good bump or a very short drop would result in enough damage to keep the printer from working properly anymore. This is the main concern I have. Unlike some other manufacturers, HP does offer some Linux support and the printer does work with Linux after a bit of fiddling with the CUPS system.<br /><br />This is a surprisingly fast little printer and it works well enough to keep up with my [very] modest printing needs. It is rated to print up to 23 ppm, and so far I have not printed anything more than a dozen pages at a time and it has churned out the pages quickly enough to suit me.<br /><br />Overall I have few complaints with this printer, beyond the build quality. It works well, it is fast and I can use either Windows or Linux to print. It is not a color laser (the price should be a good clue there) but it is fine for cranking out documents that do not require color at all.

{"rating": 4.0, "title": "Very Good Mechanical Pencil", "text": "I have for years preferred mechanical pencils to traditional wood pencils as mechanical pencils typically stay sharper and I can get finer lines with them. My instrument of choice is a Uni-Ball KuruToga which I have been using for almost 4 years now and even bought another for my wife.  I was interested in trying this Zebra mechanical pencil and comparing it to my KuruToga. It compares well and is not particularly expensive.<br /><br />This pencil has a nice hand feel to it and I can hold it and work with it without any more fatigue than when I use any other pencil. The barrel is ridged hard plastic so it is easy to grip, though I personally prefer a pencil that has a softer (rubberized) grip to make it even more comfortable.<br /><br />The innovation with this pencil is the spring loaded barrel which is designed to absorb excess pressure and prevent the lead from breaking as easily. In use, it seems to work fairly well and I have had fewer breaks than with many other pencils I have used. When you bear down hard, you can actually see the spring in the tip of the pencil compress to absorb some of the pressure. I cannot say with certainty that this is the only reason that the leads break less \u2013 the leads themselves may be a contributor.<br /><br />The main area for improvement with this pencil is the eraser, which is very small and is typical of a lot of the better mechanical pencils I have seen and used. If you plan to use this pencil a lot, plan to keep a larger eraser close by which is easier to use anyway.<br /><br />The cost of this pencil is quite reasonable. As I write this it sells here for $7, which is not terribly expensive. While disposable mechanical pencils may cost less, they quality is usually not there and in the long run you end up paying a little more than you would for a good quality pencil in the first place.<br /><br />My wife has confiscated this pencil from me and uses it now. She prefers it to the KuruToga, though I am still debating which I think is better. Regardless, this is a fine pencil and it will serve you well if you need a 0.5mm pencil that will not cost you a fortune.", "images": [], "asin": "B01LNNZS90", "parent_asin": "B01LNNZS90", "user_id": "AFLX66DKF6R3H6OEOC3TIVAYXZIQ", "timestamp": 1481190537000, "helpful_vote": 0, "verified_purchase": false}

I was curious to see how well it would work and for some things it works very well. For others things, no so much. I would consider it \u201csomewhat useful\u201d.<br /><br />This is a clipboard-sized device that uses batteries to generate an electrostatic field that can be used to attract paper, CDs and other small items to it. The idea here is that it can work as an organizational tool to keep important items off the desk and out of piles, making them a lot easier to find. The concept is simple and straightforward, and it is in some ways better than an actual clipboard as it does not apply pressure on what it\u2019s holding.<br /><br />In service, though, it is limited. It cannot hold two sheets of paper that are on top of one another unless the top sheet is offset a bit and touches the Justik surface. Thicker items such as poster board, even when small, do not stick well and are more likely to slide off. It does hold CDs, but ONLY if they are on the label side and they simply slide off if you try to place them recording side down. My guess is that it needs a non-sheer surface, as smooth plastic (even very lightweight) does not stick.<br /><br />I had trouble getting the battery compartments open to put in the 4 AA batteries. The covers simply slide off, but they are quite tight and are not easy to move until you have done them a couple of times. I suppose this is good in that the batteries will remain secure, but it also means frustration when changing the batteries.<br /><br />There is some room for improvement with this device, though it does work to some degree. It will hold papers and CDs though the capacity is limited and it is a little fussy with certain materials.

{"rating": 3.0, "title": "No FIlling Instructions and Ships with Fine Nib Instead of Medium", "text": "I will start by saying that I have not made the same observations as some of the other reviewers have made about this pen, and I will talk to those points in my review. This is not an ideal pen, though, and I found a couple of drawbacks with it that make it less than perfect. It is workable, but it lacks a few details that would make it a better product.<br /><br />One of the critical comments that has been made about this pen is that it is counterfeit. I disagree. It is marketed as an eBoot pen, and it has the logo stamped right on the cap. That does not make it a genuine article, but this is a $20 pen from a company that makes a lot of different things, not like Cross or Parker that specialize in making fine writing instruments. To counterfeit would be a waste of time.<br /><br />The pen, and the case, are definitely bamboo. This is easiest to tell by looking inside the case at the groove cut for the pen to fit inside, as well as the rounded tips on either end of the pen. There is definitely rough grain in these spots.<br /><br />Fountain pens are usually shipped with a medium nib which is suitable for most people. This one does not and instead has a fine nib which is what is typically recommended for women. A fine nib writes thinner, more delicate lines, where a medium is more bold and is what is typically recommended for men. It is unclear why this pen ships with a fine nib and not a medium nib, especially since this is not mentioned in the product description.<br /><br />The last fountain pen I used took ink cartridges. This one is refillable, but it takes the ink into a built-in ink well in the pen. It\u2019s semi-intuitive when it comes to refilling it, but there are no instructions with the pen at all which is a major shortcoming for this type of pen. There needs to be some kind of instruction on how to fill it up, how to clean it and how to do general maintenance on it.<br /><br />This pen comes with no ink at all, another minor disappointment. I would have liked to have had at least a small amount of ink come with it.<br /><br />In writing, this pen works decently. I have been able to get fine, clean lines from it. It have not had problems with globbing or leaking.<br /><br />This is not a bad pen. It does work well for me and I like the way it writes. There were some shortcuts taken in the final package though, such as not including instructions and including a non-medium nib, that make it less than ideal.<br /><br />Disclosure: I was provided a sample of this product in exchange for a fair, honest and thorough review.

{"rating": 4.0, "title": "Results Depend on the Quality of the Negatives", "text": "We have a ton of negatives from 35mm and 110 film cameras and I have wanted for some time to convert some of the photos to digital images. We also have all of the negatives from our wedding, and I was especially eager to convert all of these. This slick little device does a nice job of making images from the negatives, but it is not a miracle device - it cannot create great images from poor-quality negatives.<br /><br />This is a small and unassuming little device, roughly the size of a large pencil cup. It comes with several adapters for feeding in the various negative sizes as well as 8mm film. The device basically takes a negative snapshot of the negative generating a full-color image. It also makes full-color renders of individual sides. This works fine for individual snaps; for film reels it takes individual snaps of individual frames which means a lot of work to convert a film to a video. Keep this is mind if you intend to use it for converting film to video files.<br /><br />The results that this device generates depends very much on the quality of the negatives. Working with negatives from a good-quality 35mm camera and higher-quality film, the resulting image was good. However, when converting a negative from a lower-quality 110 camera, results were much worse. With a photo editor I was able to improve image quality to a point but it was much more effort than it was worth. In a nutshell - garbage in, garbage out.<br /><br />The user has the choice of rendering images directly to internal memory or to an SD card. I prefer rendering to an SD card as I can insert the card directly into my system to pull off the images. The internal memory supposedly will hold about 40 digital images which is fine for a start but if you have a lot of images it will fill up quickly.<br /><br />Overall this is a nice device for converting negatives and slides to digital images. It is definitely cheaper than using a service. How well it works depends on the quality of the original slides but it can make images even of bad slides regardless.

{"rating": 4.0, "title": "Decent Dry Erase Calendar", "text": "My wife is the queen of calendars. She has calendars all over the house and every one of them has all manner of notations throughout. I thought this dry erase calendar would be a good choice for her and that she would find it to be useful, and for the most part I was right. There are a couple of negatives, though, that merit mention.<br /><br />This is not a huge calendar but it\u2019s not tiny either. At 14&#34;x14&#34; it fits on most refrigerator doors or sides though it is suitable for most mounting spots. The boxes for the days are a little on the small side and may represent some minor difficulty if you have a lot to write. There\u2019s a fine balance here - too big and the calendar becomes more cumbersome, too small and it\u2019s useless. I personally am content with the size. The size does mean that you are better off with a fine-tip dry erase marker instead of a chisel-tip marker.<br /><br />The pen included with this calendar is remarkably useless. The one that came with our calendar does not write well at all and almost seems to be partially dried out. Fortunately, black fine-tip dry erase markers are inexpensive.<br /><br />The writing surface of this calendar is painted metal and is mounted on a styrofoam backing that makes it light and easy to move. It also makes it easy to dent and my particular calendar had a dented corner coming right out of the shipping box. It\u2019s not damaged to the point of useless but it is noticeable. Wrapped in clear cellophane and dropped in a box with inadequate padding, the possibility to damage is higher than it should be - it would have been nice to put it in a cardboard sleeve for shipping.<br /><br />Included with the calendar are two colorful round magnets. These are good for marking particularly important dates or marking the actual day of the week, or even for attaching something light (like a paper note) to the calendar. Smaller magnets might work better if you need to mark something on a day where you have something written.<br /><br />The Quartet Dry Erase Calendar is not a bad product at all. It is a useful tool for tracking things through the month and it is a suitable size for mounting in most places.  The price - $12 as I write this - is very reasonable for this kind of product. It does have a couple of negatives - the packaging and the pen being the two main ones - but overall this is a nice product that does a fine job of allowing someone to maintain a monthly calendar.", "images": [], "asin": "B00FW6RPEG", "parent_asin": "B00G6D79KO", "user_id": "AFLX66DKF6R3H6OEOC3TIVAYXZIQ", "timestamp": 1391255329000, "helpful_vote": 0, "verified_purchase": false}
{"rating": 4.0, "title": "Light-Duty Cutter: If Used With Care, It Works Well", "text": "This is a paper cutter suitable for small projects. While it works as intended, I found some limitations that detract from its usefulness. As such, there are a few things to keep in mind when using it that will make it a less frustrating device.<br /><br />First off, this is a small and portable paper slicer, and this is good for my needs as it can be moved all over the house. It can be used on most flat surfaces so moving from a work table to the kitchen counter is not a problem. It is lightweight and easy to move. Now, because it's a lightweight and light-duty paper slicer, it should be used with care - I don't think it will be hard to break if used like a heavy-duty gadget.<br /><br />It slices paper by use of a sliding blade that works very well, though I have found that it works best for single sheets of standard weight (20-24 lb.) paper. When I fed a light envelope through it and tried to cut it, it did cut but it required much more effort and it had a tendency to stop the blade from moving without applying some extra force. It was also difficult to hold it straight. For very lightweight paper such as some photo papers, it helps a lot to have some way to hold the edge outside of the slider because the paper tends to bunch and wrinkle instead of slicing properly. It can be worked around but it requires thinking about it BEFORE trying to cut.<br /><br />This is not a bad paper cutter. It works well and it is priced right.

{"rating": 4.0, "title": "Good Pens - Even Writing and Hard to Smear", "text": "I am very picky about the pens I use and I am always looking for good pens that write well and do not smear. These two features are difficult to find in most disposable pens. The Pilot Acroball pens handle both of these criteria and are among the better pens I have used.<br /><br />One would think there isn't much that could be said about ink pens, but there's actually several things that can be said about these.<br /><br />First off, these pens have an interesting rubber grip. Rubber grips serve two functions, providing a better grip on the pen (useful when the hands are either wet or sweaty) and reducing fatigue while writing. The rubber grips on these pens do well on the former but not so much on the latter. The texture is excellent for providing a non-slip grip that makes holding on to the pen a bit easier no matter what. However, it is made of thin, hard rubber that provides almost no cushion at all and as a result they do very little for reducing fatigue. If writing for long periods of time, these pens may not be the most comfortable.<br /><br />Most important to me is that a pen write smoothly without skipping or globbing. So far I have had no issues with these pens in that regard - ink comes out smooth and even and there are no globs of ink when I start, stop or pause in the middle of writing. I would have to say these are among the most consistent writing pens I have used when it comes to disposable pens. Also, they seem to glide over the writing surface as I write instead of scratching as I go, which is very definitely a good thing in my opinion.<br /><br />I decided to try a little experiment and set out to smear the ink as I wrote. If I tried really hard, I was able to smear the ink a little bit, but I had to do it very immediately after the ink hit the paper. When I took any time at all, the ink proved almost impossible to smear. I can't stand smudgy pens so I am very pleased with how nicely the ink in these pens stays put on the paper.<br /><br />Price-wise, these are a little expensive ($11.25 as I write this). That works out to more that $2 per pen.<br /><br />While I cannot say these are \"perfect\" pens, they are very good. They write beautifully and the ink does not smear without some effort. They are a little on the expensive side, but if very clean, consistent lines are what you need, then these pens deliver.", "images": [], "asin": "B009QYH892", "parent_asin": "B0B94KR9NQ", "user_id": "AFLX66DKF6R3H6OEOC3TIVAYXZIQ", "timestamp": 1359818568000, "helpful_vote": 0, "verified_purchase": false}
{"rating": 3.0, "title": "Excellent Quality, Fast Printing - UPDATED", "text": "UPDATE 10/24/2012 :<br /><br />I originally gave this printer 5 stars and was initially very happy with it, but I discovered a SERIOUS issue that merits some attention. My family and I noticed that the printer started a new behavior - quitting in the middle of a print job and locking up the print queue. After chasing the issue for a month I finally traced it back to the wireless network connection - the printer is unable to keep up with larger print jobs that buffer over the network. I sent a 60-page PDF to it and watched as it buffered 4-6 pages at a time, then finally dropped offline somewhere about half-way through so that it never completely buffered the whole print job. To fix it, we have to delete the print job AND power-cycle the printer before it accepts new print jobs. This is a very repeatable and predictable behavior.<br /><br />I have a reliable, stable and fast router, and no other devices have had any issues at all with staying connected, even when transferring large amounts of data. I cannot attribute the issue to my network.<br /><br />I updated the printer with the latest flash and while it seemed to help, it did not resolve the issue.<br /><br />I will be moving this printer to a USB connection instead, as there is only one computer in the house that is set up to send jobs to it. I have not yet tested the printer under similar conditions when connected via USB but considering the nature of the issue I expect it to behave as expected.<br /><br />Though a great printer for smaller jobs, it might be a little unreliable when sending larger document to it, particularly when using a wireless connection.<br /><br />My original review, unchanged, follows.<br /><br />------<br /><br />Epson is a standard name when it comes to designing inkjet printers and it is consistently near the top of the class when it comes to print quality and speed (that is especially true as of late - I had some troubles with them in the past). They have made great strides in their printer line, continually creating better and better products. The WorkForce Pro 4020 is a solid performer and is a quality product.<br /><br />It is important to keep in mind that this is not an all-in-one printer - it is just a printer and nothing more.<br /><br />The WP-4020 is a boxy printer, approximately 18\"x18\", plain black and without too much in the way of flashy decoration or fancy user interface. In short, it will win no beauty contests on its looks alone. Fortunately, looking good is not a requirement for being a good printer. The size of the printer, however, must be considered when setting up. This is a bigger printer than I expected and as a result I needed to rearrange my workspace to make room for it. It's not a huge printer, but it's not small either and it's important to consider this when looking at this printer.<br /><br />Rather than simply put everything together and turn it on, I decided to try something very novel and I followed the directions that came with the printer. The directions are very clear and concise, but I ran into in issue with the initial set-up. The directions state that the printer is to be turned on, the front panel opened and the cartridges inserted, after which the front panel is closed and the printer will start priming the cartridges for use. There is a warning to not power-cycle the printer until priming finishes. That all said, the priming process never started until after I power-cycled the printer. This is a minor complaint but it could prove confusing for some.<br /><br />Installing the printer to work on the wireless network was simple. The software installer guides you through the process and explains what to do at each step. Where it got very interesting was in connecting to the wireless network - I was never prompted for the security key, yet the printer had no issue with connecting to the network and making itself available immediately. This is very convenient, though a little disturbing.<br /><br />Once connected, the printer is immediately available and it is eager to please. It cranks out pages very quickly and the quality of print is very good. In the past I have had issues with Epson printers showing banding on color print and uneven lines when printing black and white but the new generation of Epson printers does not seem to have any issues with this - at least, not so far.<br /><br />The printer monitor driver has a number of settings for manipulating output and printer features. Duplex printing is especially useful and is easily turned on and off through the driver. There are several quick settings for handling various document types (for example, switching between grayscale and photo print) and there is a facility for creating custom fast settings. I have not seen this in the past and find this to be immensely convenient over digging through all of the settings pages and turning on and off individual settings.<br /><br />According to the documentation, the included ink cartridges should last through approximately 2 reams of paper. That's a huge improvement over smaller ink tanks that come with smaller printers.<br /><br />The Epson WorkForce Pro 4020 printer is a very solid printer with a great feature set and robust software drivers. It's fast and the print quality is excellent. If you are looking for a printer that concentrates on just printing and doing it well, this is a fine choice and deserves a look.", "images": [], "asin": "B005J31B0Q", "parent_asin": "B005J31B0Q", "user_id": "AFLX66DKF6R3H6OEOC3TIVAYXZIQ", "timestamp": 1322239237000, "helpful_vote": 3, "verified_purchase": false}

This is an understatement - these markers have very little odor at all, even when held close to the nose it is difficult to detect any odor from these markers. This is a very good thing as it means that working in an enclosed area will not result in the room smelling of markers.<br /><br />These markers write well and because of the chiseled tips they can write either thin or wide lines. The fluid comes out smooth and clean and leaves a distinct line on the whiteboard.

{"rating": 4.0, "title": "A Nice Modernization on a Classic Design", "text": "I remember having one of the original style 4-color pens when I was in school. It was a neat pen and I used it quite a bit - until it broke. That pen was not the most durable of writing tools and I was disappointed when it failed me. The new style is quite a bit better and I am mostly happy with it.<br /><br />This pen works as the original did - 4 colors, spring loaded and switching between them is as simple as pushing down on the color button representing the color ink you want. It writes well and it feels good in the hand. Two things distinguish this pen from the original, the build quality and the rubber grip.<br /><br />This is a more solid pen than the original design. It feels like it is constructed to last a bit longer under the same conditions and it holds up when when shoved in pants pockets (an easy way to break one of the older pens). One problem I noticed with the older design is that it could be jammed so that the pen would have to be taken apart to get it working again - so far, this has not been a problem with this new pen.<br /><br />The rubber grip is the other difference that sets this pen apart from its predecessor. This rubber grip is designed to combat the fatigue (aching fingers) that comes with writing for extended lengths of time, but I have found that the rubber is either too thin or too hard to help very much. It does make holding the pen a little nicer but it's not going to prevent cramping if using the pen for a while.<br /><br />This is a worthwhile redesign of an old classic, and the price point is very reasonable.", "images": [], "asin": "B004INGE4G", "parent_asin": "B004INGE4G", "user_id": "AFLX66DKF6R3H6OEOC3TIVAYXZIQ", "timestamp": 1305371395000, "helpful_vote": 0, "verified_purchase": false}
{"rating": 4.0, "title": "Very nice entry-level 3-in-one printer", "text": "Epson has for years been a leader in the printer market and has delivered good products to consumers. The NX415 is Epson's budget 3-in-one printer, with print, scan and copy capabilities. It is not perfect but it is difficult to overlook the price advantage.<br /><br />Setting up the NX415 is simple and easy, except that there is no USB cable in the box. This is an aggravation that is easily avoidable. Considering that USB cables cost less than $3 US to wholesalers, there's little reason to not include one in the box. That said, the instructions for configuration and setup are clear and easy and the printer can be ready to go in a matter of just a few minutes.<br /><br />This is one of the fastest printers I have worked with, though it is a bit noisy when churning out pages. There is a configuration setting that allows the user to print in \"quiet mode\" but the print speeds are reduced. I recommend using this mode, as the speed difference is not large and the noise difference is very appreciable.<br /><br />One of the nicest features of this printer is the easy-to-follow display panel. Even though it is small it is very easy to read and the directions for changing settings are very clear. It is also tilt-able which makes reading it easier depending on how it is set.<br /><br />I like the size footprint of this printer. This is much smaller than my Canon Pixma printer, and that's important to me as there is a premium on desk space. It tucks away neatly into a corner and is still very accessible.<br /><br />I have not tried printing photos, but I have used it for multiple print tasks, specifically printing charts in black-and-white and in copying forms. It performs these tasks well.<br /><br />There is one negative that is really worth mentioning - this printer guzzles ink. The printer itself is inexpensive but keep in mind that cartridges add up quickly. For volume printing, this is not a good choice; for light or even moderate print volume this printer is acceptable.<br /><br />Epson also has an NX515, which is the same as the NX415 but includes wireless networkability. There is a cost difference, of course, and if wireless connectivity for the printer is not needed then the NX415 is a better choice from a price perspective.<br /><br />Epson's NX415 3-in-one inkjet is a fine printer. It will serve a family or a small office well. It does tend to cost more per page to print as the ink consumption is high, but the speed and quality of output is a good counterbalance. Consider this printer when looking for a good quality budget 3-in-one.", "images": [], "asin": "B0026ZPK34", "parent_asin": "B0026ZPK34", "user_id": "AFLX66DKF6R3H6OEOC3TIVAYXZIQ", "timestamp": 1257426527000, "helpful_vote": 5, "verified_purchase": false}

{"rating": 1.0, "title": "Good for home use until the dreaded printhead issue- Do not buy!", "text": "For the price the Kodak ESP C315 is an acceptable printer for home use. I did have an issue with a paper jam when printing my daughter's book report. Perhaps it's a bit finicky when printing multiple pages at once. My other printer at home is a Canon MG5220. There are things I really like about it, such as the enclosed paper tray for 8 1/2 x 11 paper. I wish Kodak would implement that option, as the open rear paper tray seems to be a major dust & pet hair catcher around here. I like the more efficient ink cartridges in the Kodak printer. Replacing the cartridges in the Canon can be really expensive so this is a definite improvement. All in all, I'd say this is a good printer for using at home.<br /><br />Update- I'd put the Kodak printer back in the box, and was using my Canon until recently. I brought it back out beginning of September when I needed it for printing my children's homework assignments. Within a couple weeks of use I began to have issues with the printhead. I kept getting errors that \"the printhead is missing or installed incorrectly\" no matter how many times I removed and put it back in. After looking around online I see that this is a common issue with the Kodak series, that some have had to contact Customer Service and get a new printhead upwards of 6 or more times. This is ridiculous. I printed maybe 20 pages total before the issue began. I was able to get a replacement printhead from Kodak customer support but it took nearly an hour on their Live Help before they'd send me one.

The answered questions above were accurate with regard to how much space there is between the underside of the table and the tray...etc.Only 4 stars because it was quite a pain to put together. Had to flip my desk upside down to make sure I could see that all the holes were lined up before I drilled...I'm handy, but it took me many sweaty hours to finish. But worth it because it FITS MY BIG OLD MICROSOFT ERGONOMIC KEYBOARD!<br />UPDATE:<br />Out of pity for others who are trying to figure out whether they can really install this thing, I have now added two photos. The first is a basic shot of the keyboard tray underneath my desk, with a focus on the depth of the product. The second is a really quick drawing I made of it, indicating measurements. The numbers (if you can't read them in the photo) are from top to bottom: 11 3/4 inches, 8 3/4 inches, 14 1/8 inches (when closed), and 22 3/4 inches (when fully extended). My tray was mounted so that the edge of the keyboard is flush with the edge of my desk...you need not make it flush, but it might look best if it is flush.<br />What I had to really pay attention to was where the screws needed to go in!!! I had a gap in the underpaneling of my desk, and I was forced to use a very long screw to secure the deepest brackets. Hard to explain, but trust me--not fun. The point is, the measurement that mattered to me most was NOT 'how deep is the tray' but 'how far apart are the screw brackets'...and that is why I added these photos.<br />Hope they help someone.<br />Edit:<br />I am adding 3 new photos to help someone. The three new photos are all taken with the keyboard tray fully closed (as far as it will slide in). The tape measure reads pretty clearly in the photos I think. The third photo is of the front of the tray. The fifth and last photo is taken from under the desk looking up at the back of the tray. Yes, when fully closed, the glide rails stick out a bit beyond the wood tray--again this in the back.

Because of the size of the whiteboard, this takes out quite a bit of writing space. In theory, it should work well for things like the pomodoro technique, where you can write a task and set a timer for it. But writing more than that is not possible. Also, as for the actual writing experience, it's quite uncomfortable. There's a nice tray in the back to keep markers and erasers, but it's non-removable.

There's a deep groove at the top to hold a couple writing instruments; I store a couple dry-erase markers in there.

I currently use Pilot Board Master S (ultra fine); they're too narrow for the circle groove, so it tilts a bit, but they're perfect for the longer groove on top.<br /><br />The board is very easy to clean and indeed glass. In fact, all it is is just clear glass over a white base. I wish I got a non-glass version because the glass creates a small shadow underneath the writing, but it's not that big a deal. I just like the cleaner look of marker on a non-glass whiteboard.<br /><br />To the right there's a calculator. Admittedly, I put that thing out of site because (1) I already have a few calculators and (2) I wanted to use it for more storage. Thankfully, it's removable, revealing two storage compartments underneath (albeit uncovered without the calculator).

The 1.0 size doesn't bother me at all.  But the blue ink is light...very light.  It reminds me of  a pen that is running out of ink and getting lighter and lighter.<br /><br />PrevaGuard is described as follows, per the info above:  \"Contains an agent incorporated into the plastic that protects the pen itself by suppressing the growth of bacteria, algae, fungus and mildew.\"<br /><br />It then goes on to say:<br /><br />\"These products protect the pens themselves and do not protect users or others from disease causing bacteria, viruses or germs\"<br /><br />I'm not quite understanding this.  Prevaguard protects the pen but not people? Why would the pens need protection? Are they saying PrevaGuard protects the pen AND people from bacteria, algae, mildew and fungus but does  NOT protect people from disease causing bacteria, viruses and germs???  Maybe its just me but PrevaGuard has me confused.<br /><br />On a good note, the pens are comfortable to hold.  And they outlast the Papermate Ink Joy pen by 90%.

{"rating": 4.0, "title": "Good Pen...(PrevaGuard protects the PEN from germs, NOT People)", "text": "After reading that BIC prevaguard pens contain an antimicrobial agent molded directly into the pen to help suppress the growth of mold, mildew, bacteria and fungi, I  took it  to mean it helped keep the pen free of germs as a safety measure for people.  Only after  I re-read the info again a number of times did I realize the antimicrobial agent is to protect the PEN, not people.  The protection given by the antimicrobial agent keeps mold, mildew, bacteria and fungi out of the pen while at the same time, keeping the pen fresh, odor free, staining and pen degradation.  The agent lasts for the life of the pen  unless the plastic portion is destroyed/broken.  The box contains 12 pens total and all 12 are 1.0mm medium point which allows the pen to writing smooth and easy. The pen is comfortable to hold and write with and its very thin. (Personally, I'd prefer the pens to be a bit thicker in width, but that's just me) These are clic pens and the clicker works well to open /close the pen. I received blue pens but black is available as well.  The price is reasonable. BIC is known for quality items. Its pretty innovative that they created an agent to prevent the pen from going bad and lasting a long time.  These pens are perfect for pretty much anyone who uses pens.

We have alarms on our phones to remind us to start thinking about dinner at 6:30p every day, but then the game of \"what's for dinner\" begins. This awesome product helps us figure that out ahead of time.<br /><br />The entire board is magnetic which means it latched onto our fridge and didn't want to let go. It was a little crooked at first and I had to peel it completely off in order to realign it. The board comes with four pens (red, green, blue and black) and the pens have two awesome features: they have dry erasers on their lids - which makes changing the board a breeze; and they are magnetic - this keeps them close at hand and not stuck in a drawer.<br /><br />The package also includes a larger dry eraser, which is surprisingly magnetic as well. I didn't realize it at first because it wouldn't stick to the fridge but it does stick a little bit.. however, its magnet is not very strong so I'm not sure how well it will stay up when the door is opened and closed.<br /><br />There are also four smaller decorative magnets included. The images on mine are a sunset, a castle, a dandelion and some odd ensemble of cartoon caricatures.. no clue what or who they are supposed to be. I'll be giving that magnet to one of my grand kids. Perhaps they'll be familiar with the picture.<br /><br />The only negative is that, despite being shipped in a flat package (very nice touch, by the way), the upper left corner of my board is creased. The magnetic grasp of the board does not seem to be affected (it is not curled up away from the fridge or anything) but it is slightly annoying as it reduces the overall aesthetics of the board.<br /><br />Overall, I am SO happy with this! My husband and I just finished filling it out for next week. The pens write on it really well and they don't run. If anything the tips are a little thick for the space provided. Let me just tell you now.. you will not be able to write as small and clear as the images included in the listing, at least not with the pens included.

For me, though, using the pen that came with the RocketBook, the writing was like... you know how you use a gel pen and it's *thisclose* to bring out of ink, so the writing is 'spotty'? You find yourself shaking the pen and trying to finish the word or sentence or list you started without having to go back to the kitchen junk drawer or top desk drawer or your purse to find another pen? That's the way the writing was coming out on the page. So, off to the big box 'office supplies for twice as much... that was easy [money for them]' and I bought a package of the Frixion pens. It wasn't until I was standing there, forced to actually shop in person, that I realized that these Frixion pens write on ANY paper and erase with... \ud83d\udca1DUH!!... friction. Bought the multipack of pens, got home, tore the pack open, went to finish my list and the black pen in the multipack wrote just as cruddy. As did the navy blue, the royal blue, the red... all of 'em. So, I grabbed a clean sheet of paper and used one of my new pens (clickable with the rubber 'eraser') and they write splendidly on paper. They also 'erase' perfectly on paper.<br /><br />Verdict: The RocketBook is not for me. I'm too ocd or too perfectionist or lack enough patience for a $32+ book with like 5 pages that makes all my lists and notes look like I have a dried out pen. I don't need the app, probably would have never used it anyway. So I sent the RocketBook back for a full refund.

I quickly went through the first four Epson color ink bottles and was already halfway through the second box of Epson ink refill bottles when the unit failed, after only 4 months of moderate use. The description suggested the ink refills would last up to two years. I didn't expect the refills to last that long, but less than four months is quite a bit short of the predicted ink use. We don't print every day, and certainly not in huge quantities.<br /><br />Second issue: From the time of purchase, I needed to clean print heads frequently due to the print quality being unreadable on parts of the page. I'd never experienced this with previous printers. Photo 2.<br /><br />Third issue: This printer became unusable when it could no longer print documents from a website, like Amazon. Instead of the printer recognizing and printing letters and/or numbers, it substituted blobs of ink instead. End result, I had a printer that couldn't print receipts or other online information. This problem developed about two months after we purchased it. Photo 1.<br /><br />Replacement policy: When I contacted Epson, the phone rep indicated that he thought it was possibly a hardware issue. To get a replacement printer, Epson would send a box for the printer. I was to mail the printer back to the company. Once they received the printer, they would send me a replacement. However I had to send them a check for nearly $200 before they would send the box.<br /><br />I would have been happy to receive the return box and mail the printer to Epson, then waited for them to OK the return, and send me a replacement printer. That wasn't an option.<br /><br />I opted to NOT send Epson either the printer or the money.

Unfortunately it mostly goes unused, and we've started using one of the extra-large, elasticized \"floppy\" covers instead.<br /><br />Basically, the cover is very well designed, it's just too small. I love the little side pillows, which can be removed as baby gets bigger. The pockets and toy straps are really useful, and the way the bag rolls up into a neat little duffel is pretty ingenious. The design for attaching the cover to the cart using Velcro would be terrific - if it fit! Unfortunately, this cover is too small to be used properly in an average size shopping cart. I tried it on the carts at Target, and there was no way I could actually wrap the front of the cover around the handle of the cart and attach it with the provided Velcro. If I had, the bottom of the leg openings would sit about five inches ABOVE the seat! I've examined the photo included with the product description closely and concluded that either the one they sent me is much smaller, or the shopping cart used for the photo is incredibly small.<br /><br />Oh, and one other thing - the color and pattern. Not a big deal, but the color/pattern is not as pictured on the product description. It is indeed a \"sage pin dot\" - that is, it's sage green with white pin or polka dots.<br /><br />Overall a great idea for a design, but poorly executed.

Having a printer that is easily portable and easily connectable is great when you\u2019re on the run and this need convinced me to get this HPRT Wireless Portable Printer.<br /><br />Setting up this printer requires a few simple steps. First, you need to open the top, take out the paper roll, and tear it to get it ready to print. You then feed the edge of the paper through the slot and snap the lid shut. Next, you need to go online and download the printer driver, then install on your pc. If you want to print from your phone, you just download the Hereprint app.<br /><br />The best feature of this printer is its portability and its best use is printing from your phone, through the app. I already have regular printers at home and at work, so I don\u2019t really need help in these places. But I often do need to print from other locations and I like that this small, skinny printer can be taken anywhere and that I can send documents to it, straight from my smartphone.<br /><br />As for quality, this printer is best for printing documents. I have tried printing pictures and the quality is not the best. The other issue I have with this printer is that it requires rolls of paper, which means you need to have a supply on hand, and they are not that easy to find. I would prefer just feeding individual 8.5 by 11 inch sheets, but you can\u2019t do that with this printer. You have to use a paper roll.<br /><br />Printing will never go completely out of style. Printers are generally inexpensive nowadays and are available most anywhere. But portable printers are not widely available and thus a printer like this fulfills a specific need. It is limited in its ability to produce a quality print and the need to buy rolls of paper is a concern.

{"rating": 3.0, "title": "Motivational Sayings Can Make a Difference", "text": "Children can benefit from receiving reminders when they do well and from receiving encouraging words when they have doubts. In a classroom setting, one easy way to achieve this is with posters and a possible choice for encouragement is this Growth Mindset Posters Bulletin Board Set from Tenare.<br /><br />This set contains small, individual sayings intended to motivate kids. They are made from carboard and can be placed on walls, chalkboards, or any place else where kids can view them and, hopefully, be encouraged by what they read. There are two pieces shaped like halves of a human brain, a rectangular piece, plus individual words and short sayings, separated into two subgroups: Fixed and Growth. The Fixed have to do with fixed mindsets; the growth have to do with ways to change or improve.<br /><br />One issue I have with this set is that some of the statements are negative. I understand that the whole idea is to get kids to realize that these negative thoughts can be changed through growth. But if you\u2019re working with kids who are under performing, they may already be thinking those things and certainly don\u2019t need to hear it or see it permanently displayed on a wall. If they\u2019re not thinking these negative thoughts, then I think it is best not to plant the seed.<br /><br />So, to make the set best, I recommend using only the positive ones. The colors on both definitely brighten up the room and if you stick with the positive statements of encouragement, the desired outcome will be achieved. Yes, these are just sayings but sometimes, this is all you need to get children to do better.<br /><br />Statements of encouragement can motivate children and this Growth Mindset Posters Bulletin Board Set is generally good overall.

The four supports are not attached. They merely rest between the trays. That means a good bump is all that is necessary to knock the top tray down. I am not sure why they made it this way, as this is definitely a design flaw.<br /><br />Because of the problem with the supports, we have decided to use the trays unstacked and, in this way, they are fine.

{"rating": 3.0, "title": "Swingline Optima Handles the Big Stapling Jobs, Most of the Time", "text": "Stapling is still a necessity in the office and often in the home, but most staplers cannot handle very many sheets of paper and require too hard/swift of a push to get the stapler to work properly. For these purposes, an electric stapler does the trick and the Swingline Optima Stapler is one worth considering when you need to staple lots of paper with little effort.<br /><br />I use staplers in the home, but I use them even more at work and my greatest frustration with regular staplers is that they cannot staple a thick stack of papers. You might be able to make it work, with a really hard, fast push, but mechanical staplers are just not made for this type of task. With the Swingline Optima, the staples are delivered quietly and with little more than a touch. They easily push their way through a large stack of paper and I have found that I no longer need binder clips like I once did. This stapler can attach where my mechanical one could not, so the binder clips can be saved for other uses.<br /><br />This stapler is larger and heavier than most and it does take up more desk space. It has a nice appearance and it does work in most instances. I have, however, had a few problems and one is with staple jams. Not all standard staples work and I don\u2019t like that the manufacturer claims they will work BUT guarantees smooth operation only with the recommended optima staples. Still, the jams are not that frequent to really matter, at least not for me. I can staple twenty times in a row and have only one mishap, so I suppose that isn\u2019t too bad.<br /><br />Stapling will be around as long as paper is around and it is nice to have an electric stapler capable of fastening a large stack of paper with a light touch. I have never put this stapler to the test by attempting to staple 45 sheets, but I have used upward of 30 with satisfactory results. It\u2019s a good product, but it does have some issues and unless one really needs the power of an electric stapler, it may not be worth it. I\u2019m going to give it the middle rating of 3 stars, as I feel it has its share of pros and cons.", "images": [], "asin": "B001PME0VM", "parent_asin": "B09BKNFXVL", "user_id": "AFERCDY2EFJKT7QUQ75GISNHTFOQ", "timestamp": 1385170575000, "helpful_vote": 0, "verified_purchase": false}
{"rating": 3.0, "title": "Cross- Cut Security for a Low Price", "text": "The Aurora AS890C Shredder is a small to medium size shredder perfect for those who need to shred on occasion but do not need a large, heavy duty machine to do the job. Its size makes it useful for either the home or office where it can easily fit into small, compact spaces.<br /><br />Shredders are necessary for destroying confidential information and one factor that sets them apart is the way they cut. This shredder is a crosscut shredder, which means it shreds the paper into small pieces rather than in long, ribbon- like strands. Many like the cross cut method better because it makes it nearly impossible to join the pieces back together.  I agree that crosscut is better, but keep in mind is that, while the manufacturer likes to say this is a confetti type shredder, this statement should not be taken literally. It doesn't cut the paper into tiny squares, like pieces of confetti, but rather into rectangular pieces about 1.5 inches in length and three- eighths of an inch in width. This is not what I would call confetti, but it is certainly good enough to deter potential thieves.<br /><br />I like the way this shredder slices up paper and I like that it can handle credit cards, paper clips, and staples without jamming. But I still have a few issues with this shredder and the first one is its claim that it can handle up to eight sheets of paper. Unless the paper in your hands is tissue paper, eight sheets will likely not work very well. Place eight sheets in this shredder at once and it might be able to handle them, or it may jam and have to be reveresed. I find it works best if the number of sheets is limited to no more than six.<br /><br />The other important issue I have with this shredder is one you don't notice at first, and that it its lack of a continuous \"ON\" setting. What that means is that you cannot turn it on and leave it running while you feed through multiple stacks of paper. There is nothing more than an Auto setting and while this is fine for most shredding uses, it doesn't work so well when you have a large stack of paper to shred at once. With an Auto setting, the shredder shuts itself off a second or two after each shredding. With a large stack of paper to shred, the lack of an ON setting will add some time to the task.<br /><br />Shredders are essential for both the home and office and while most are similar in what they do, there are some key differences that make some better than others. The Aurora AS890C Shredder is lacking in a few areas, but it is still a good shredder for home or office and one I will continue to use when sensitive documents need to be safely eliminated. The cross- cut action is very good and while I would like it better if there was an \"On\" setting and other features, it still has many good qualities and it is tough to beat for the price.", "images": [], "asin": "B000QX77WK", "parent_asin": "B07K54MZBY", "user_id": "AFERCDY2EFJKT7QUQ75GISNHTFOQ", "timestamp": 1342374004000, "helpful_vote": 6, "verified_purchase": false}
{"rating": 1.0, "title": "You're Better off Removing the Batteries and Sharpening Manually", "text": "Pens are the writing utensil of choice, but I still like to use pencils from time to time, due to their erasability and other factors. The reason many hesitate to use pencils is, of course, the inconvenience of having to sharpen, but this problem is easily remedied with the right pencil sharpener. A good electric sharpener does the work for you, eliminating much of the inconvenience that makes people avoid using pencils in the first place.<br /><br />The Stanley Bostitch Minisharp Battery Powered pencil sharpener is, unfortunately, not the good, convenience- enhancing pencil sharpener I was hoping for. This pencil sharpener is about as simple and basic as an electric powered sharpener could be, with nothing more than a small blade on the inside that looks much like a tiny, manually operated pencil sharpener. It turns when a pencil is inserted, but the problem is that it doesn't work very well at all. At first, I was convinced that I was doing something wrong but I found that no matter how I held the pencil, whether I held it steady or turned it back and forth, the blade just didn't do the job. It sharpened so slowly I gave up and resorted to manual sharpening.<br /><br />Another issue I have with this pencil sharpener is the lack of instructions. You will eventually figure out how to perform tasks like opening the battery compartment, inserting the batteries, and releasing the door for waste removal, but the manufacturer should have provided a simple set of instructions explaining this. Your frustration level is piqued from the beginning, and it doesn't get any better when you discover that the device doesn't work.<br /><br />If there is anything good to say about this pencil sharpener, it would come down to two main things: The compact size and the portability. It is small enough to fit in the tiniest desk space or school bag and because it doesn't have an electrical cord, it can be taken anywhere. I also like the see- through compartment that holds the shavings because you can quickly see when it is full and know when to empty. Compartments on some pencil sharpeners are tinted and you can't really see the shavings very well, which can lead to overfilling. There is no problem like that with this pencil sharpener, but considering its performance, it is highly doubtful the shavings compartment will ever reach its capacity.<br /><br />Everyone who uses pencils needs a good, convenient sharpener but this Stanley Bostitch model isn't one of them. I finally gave up, took out the batteries, stuck my pencil inside and turned it manually. The sharpening was faster and better than using it powered. And this says quite a bit about the quality and usefulness of this device.<br /><br />Avoid it, spend the extra money, and get a better product.", "images": [], "asin": "B004I5AQ4S", "parent_asin": "B004I5AQ4S", "user_id": "AFERCDY2EFJKT7QUQ75GISNHTFOQ", "timestamp": 1323313051000, "helpful_vote": 1, "verified_purchase": false}

Yes, and Recycled Paper Construction, Too", "text": "Ampad #10 Recycled Envelopes with Moisture Seal Closure are one of several envelope products made by the Ampad company and they are one of many different Ampad products that are manufactured in an environmentally- friendly way using recycled paper. These envelopes provide most of the qualities an individual or business wants in an envelope for a fair price.<br /><br />I'm generally not too picky about envelopes, but I do insist on a few minimum qualities. One quality I like that I didn't care about in the past is the use of recycled paper. If you think about it, there is really no good reason not to use recycled paper when manufacturing envelopes because they are not something we purchase to keep. They are disposable, and all that matters is that they are good enough to protect the contents on the way to the final destination. Recycled paper is fine for this purpose, and these Ampad envelopes are made completely from recycled paper, so they earn extra points in this area.<br /><br />Are Ampad Recycled Envelopes without any flaws? Well, I do have two complaints, and the first is the thin, flimsy design. From my experience, these envelopes are still fine for mailing letters from home and they have no problem holding up for most uses. But one has to be a little careful with overstuffing the envelopes because they may tear. Another potential problem is with postage machines. If you need to run your envelopes through a postage machine, there is once again a chance these envelopes will tear. It depends on how much is inside the envelopes and the type of postage meter used.<br /><br />Envelopes are a product most people take for granted and few give much thought to what they purchase. Ampad #10 Recycled Envelopes with Moisture Seal Closure are a good envelope from Ampad with a few drawbacks that prevent them from receiving a great rating. These envelopes could be improved with a little thicker construction to prevent tearing and since there is no security lining, they may not be suitable for mailing certain items.

It is the type of calculator you turn to when you need to add up some numbers quickly and don't have a need to pull out the larger, bulkier, or more sophisticated devices.<br /><br />This calculator has large buttons and pretty large display for easy reading. This is good for those with larger fingers and for those who have trouble reading a small display. The display tilts toward the user for easier viewing and the LCD panel holds eight digits so it is fine for most business uses. This means, of course, that it will only hold numbers less than $100 million. If a function is plugged into the calculator that exceeds this value, the display will show an error. It won't switch to scientific notation like some of the more sophisticated calculators. It will error- out.<br /><br />Office Depot 880 calculator is battery and solar powered. The solar panel is small, but it is really all you need to power something this simple. The one I have has been using the same battery for years and I don't know if it will ever run out.

{"rating": 2.0, "title": "Hewlett Packard Lays an Egg", "text": "Hewlett- Packard's model 4215 multi- function machine is an office device that can be used for printing, copying, faxing, and scanning. Its multiple functions make it appealing to those who want a single machine capable of performing many functions. It is offered for a fair price, so it seems like the type of purchase where one can't go wrong.<br /><br />But if one looks beneath the surface, it won't take too long to discover some of the flaws inherent in this device. I have been using this at my workplace for about seven months and there are many annoyances about this office machine that make it less than desirable. Starting with the fax, I like the fact that there are 80 preset numbers you can program for speed dialing. But I don't like the slowness of the feed and the slow, limited memory. I also don't like the fact that I often have to push the first sheet of paper to get the fax going. It often is unable to grab the first sheet on its own.<br /><br />For scanning and copying, this device works ok but again it is very slow. I don't recommend its use for copying because the slowness is too much- you are better off waiting in line at a real copier than pacing back and forth while this machine attempts to make copies.<br /><br />Printing is the machine's other function and here, it earns average marks at best. It feeds the paper through at a decent clip (17 ppm for black and 12 ppm for color), but it uses more ink that most printers. One ink cartridge sells for only about $20, but a single cartridge is good for only about 400 sheets using black ink (color cartridge costs about $35 and prints just 350 sheets). This is more costly than other printers in my office and that is the main reason why I don't use this device for printing.<br /><br />This machine makes a decent one for faxing, but its other features rate either average or below. This isn't one of Hewlett- Packard's better printing devices and while I agree the base price is good for a multi- function device, I don't think this product is up to the usual high standards for a company like HP.", "images": [], "asin": "B0001M3W7A", "parent_asin": "B0001M3W7A", "user_id": "AFERCDY2EFJKT7QUQ75GISNHTFOQ", "timestamp": 1134002706000, "helpful_vote": 21, "verified_purchase": false}
{"rating": 2.0, "title": "Lethargic Little Shredder from Royal", "text": "Royal VF1000MX is a medium to compact size shredder for home or office. This unit is multi- purpose and is capable of shredding paper and other items, like CD's and credit cards. It features crosscut action, slicing papers and various forms of media lengthwise and then sideways, making it tougher to piece the shredded material back together.<br /><br />The cutting action of this shredder is ok, even if not the best on the market. But there are still a few things about this shredder that I find less than ideal. First of all, the receptacle that holds the cut up paper isn't very large and it fills very quickly. There is a small window on the front that you can glance at from time to time to see if the level is too high. The problem is, since this shredder usually sits on the floor, you tend not to notice the level in the window. And if it overfills, the shredder will not accept any more paper. To add to the problem, removing the receptacle when it's overfilled with shredded paper creates a huge mess because the clippings spill out quickly, before you can catch them.<br /><br />This shredder is also a little less durable than other makes. The one I use has begun to malfunction after just 18 months of use. The problem is that it no longer shuts off automatically following the shredding of a piece of paper. With the setting on \"auto\", this is how it is supposed to work. Now, I have to manually move the switch to \"off\" or it will not stop.<br /><br />Other problems with this shredder include overloading and excessive noise. Royal claims this shredder is capable of handling up to ten sheets of paper at a time, but the company must be referring to tissue paper, because if I attempt to cram ten sheets into the opening, it makes an agonizing noise, overloads itself, and the blades stop turning. At this point, you have to move the switch to reverse to get the paper out, separate into smaller piles, and try again. It is also very noisy for a shredder its size, producing a loud grinding noise that makes it impossible to talk on the telephone within ten feet of the device.<br /><br />If you need a shredder for small jobs in the home or office, this shredder might be adequate. But for a large office where many people need a shredder, this device is impractical.

There is always a challenge with these larger and very fragile documents.  Based on the size of the scanner and the advertising saying it does sizes up to 8.5x14, we made a bad assumption that this was the dream scanner.  Bad news, to get sizes larger that 8.5 x 11 you have to use the ADF (automatic document feeder), which is unthinkable with fragile documents... not to mention forbidden.  There is a sentence in the nice long description that says \"the 8.5x11.7 inch flatbed\", which we missed.  This is our fault for not reading the description 3 times over.  I can not testify as to how well it works, sets up, etc... we had simply unpackaged it enough to open the lid when we determined we did not buy what we needed.  If someone needs a standard size scanner without a document feeder, save yourself $145 and try Canon CanoScan LiDE210 Color Image Scanner (4508B002) [[ASIN:B003VQR1TS Canon CanoScan LiDE210 Color Image Scanner (4508B002)]].

You can't really go wrong with this pad- it helps relieve pressure from your wrist so you're less likely to get hand cramps or have your hand fall asleep. It's a convenient size too so that it'll nicely fit on your desk without forcing you to make more room for it. The little bump out on the left of the pad aids in the natural movements of the mouse so you will be able to use your mouse without falling off of the pad. The bottom has a slightly sticky rubber to keep the pad in place on your desk but will not leave any residue. If you need a mousepad with some gel wrist support for a good cost, you won't be disappointed with this one. JETech has always come through with simple and cost effective products for people who need something and don't have specific demands- great for offices.<br /><br />UPDATE: I've had this mousepad for longer than a year but with less than average use. Like other reviewers' pads it has come undone at the bottom with the gel coming out. I can no longer recommend this mousepad.

The barrel actually flexes a little like there's rubber in the mix. They are neat looking and that's where it ends. Again, I've written with a #2 for easily forty five years. I know what a #2 pencil feels like when I write with one. These write nothing like a #2 pencil. It feels. . . waxy, the tip doesn't grip the paper, it slips along. It feels totally wrong. I know what writing from a #2 pencil looks like. What comes out of these pencils (I almost want to put pencil i quotes here) looks, and feels like trying to write on slippery thermal receipt paper. I was using an old Composition notebook that I've had for years. I could barely make out what I wrote no matter how hard I pressed. The words looked waxy or greasy.

Another problem we had, because the pens aren't marked and even though there's Basic, Pastel, Neon, Neon Glitter, Metallic and Colored Glitter. They all seem the same. The 'glitter' pens don't write/color in glitter the glitter as far as I can tell (the glittering being in the barrel of the pen far away from the ink was a big clue) glitter is just decorative part of the pen and not part of the ink. Trying multiple pens from different racks it was really hard to tell there was any real difference in the colors as far as metallic or neon and basic go. I had an easier time than my elderly mother coloring smoothly and with complete coverage but I still think a good set of colored pencils is far better to color with than ball-point pens. I think kids and teens would have more fun than adults with these.", "images": [], "asin": "B01FFYIUUW", "parent_asin": "B01FFYIUUW", "user_id": "AFUSWNVA72MMWHGYWJ652SYX2JJQ", "timestamp": 1470622900000, "helpful_vote": 1, "verified_purchase": false}
{"rating": 3.0, "title": "Decent Set of Pencils", "text": "Personally I prefer round pencils. Standard design 6-sided hextuple pencils tend to dig painfully into my hand and fingers. Granted they don't roll away as easily as round pencils do but I'd still take round over angles any day. My other problem with this set is there's no color guide included or available (confirmed by the seller) with the pencils or any color names on the pencils. The manufacturer's name and a number are embossed on each pencil but nothing to tell you what the color is. My 85 year old mother has a serious problem with the lack of color names or a color chart that corresponds to their numbering system.<br />That all being said, these do color very nicely and smoothly and you can put down a light color or darken it easily with just a bit more pressure. The tin they come in is two layers, 24 different colors per level and you can put the 1st layer in the lid while working to keep everything in one place. It's a good set of pencils just not a great set.

{"rating": 3.0, "title": "Looks Great, Writes Poorly", "text": "The pen itself is beautiful. The blue and chrome are stunning together. This comes with a felt sheath to store the pen in which is a little hard to get the pen into or out of as the clip is very tight. It does fit a shirt pocket, without the felt sheath, nicely even with a pocket protector. The pen has a nice heft, feels very well made and solid. . . and then you get to the bad part. When writing, and it's not just me I've handed this to two other people without a word and asked for their opinion and both of them said the same thing. The roller-ball grabs, scratches and stutters as you write which is too bad because it lays down a nice wet and dark line of ink that dries not quickly but doesn't stay wet all that long. But no matter how attractive a pen is when all is said and done a pen is something you use to write. If all you use it for is signing your name maybe you won't notice but I wrote an entire page as did a friend of mine and the way the pen writes is so distracting neither of us could enjoy using the pen. I even spent ten minutes scribbling constantly with the pen thinking maybe the roller-ball needed to 'break in' but it still did the same hitching, catching and stuttering.

{"rating": 3.0, "title": "They're Nice. . . But", "text": "First off I'm just going to say this; I don't mind being asked to review a product and enjoy it at times. What I dislike quite a lot is receiving several notes in the packaging specifically encouraging I write a five star review of the product. On to the product. . .<br /><br />The labels are a heavy gauge vinyl and stick well to dry surfaces. Removal and reuse was okay, I was able to get about three uses before the edges would stop adhering. The marker design is interesting. You can flip the tip, easily but a bit messily, from a round point to a chisel tip. The liquid chalk writes quite wet and takes a while to dry. Once dry you need to be careful how you handle the labels. Moderate pressure causes the chalk to halo and spread out. The slightest dampness, such as the humid environment in a 'fridge or damp fingers, will cause the chalk to badly smear. Oddly enough I found it almost impossible to completely remove the chalk from a label even using glass cleaner there was a white haze left behind.<br /><br />Maybe with a more permanent white marker things would be better. I'd rather not be able to reuse the labels for less risk of smearing. The labels are attractive in an old timey way.

{"rating": 3.0, "title": "Mediocre Laser Printer from Canon.", "text": "The imageCLASS MF8280cw printer is definitely not your average home printer. Unfortunately because the cassette holding only 150 sheets of paper it's not really much of a business printer either.<br /><br />Make sure you have a friend around to help you move and set up this printer. You're also going to need a sturdy place to put it. At almost 60 pounds and measuring 17\" x 19\" it's quite a beast and will take up quite a bit of table/desk top real estate.<br /><br />Print speed, advertized at 14 ppm, is good but not all that fast. Print quality of text is, as are most laser printers, exceptional. Print quality of images on the other hand is poor. I've tried numerous color profiles and settings on board the printer but I haven't been able to achieve color matching that I would even call fair let alone good. Even printing simple pie charts with specific colors (red, green, blue, etc.) set by their decimal numbers the color output was off. Blues are too dark. Yellows are orangeish. Grey areas are blue tinted. I spent an hour or so and used up close to 50 prints trying to get good color output but the best I could get out of the printer was mediocre.<br /><br />Scan speed is amazingly fast but scan quality of images is only good. Text scanning quality is very good. The highest resolution setting for scanning is 600 DPI which isn't that impressive. It's good for documents and not much else. The biggest annoyance with scanning was every time I wanted to scan something I would have to stop what I was doing, wake the printer up from standby mode, switch to the scan mode and then change the device setting to 'remote scanner' even though the printer is connected to my PC via a USB cable. I found this to be annoying.<br /><br />Copying is quite fast and accurate. I scanned several invoices and documents and all were square and true with good quality.<br /><br />I only used the fax feature once but it worked quite well and reasonably quickly.<br /><br />The ADF tray hold 50 sheets and does a good job of feeding paper. You don't have to sit there and nudge items to get the rollers to grab them.<br /><br />Wireless setup seems easy and painless although neither of my tablets will see the printer and my PC lacks a wireless card. The printer pulls an IP address from my wireless router but that's as far as I was able to get with testing the wireless capability.<br /><br />In conclusion... this printer is too large for most home offices and the limited paper capacity makes it cumbersome for all but the smallest of businesses. Currently a replacement set of four toner cartridges for this printer will cost you well over three hundred dollars and with an average of only 1,450 pages per set of cartridges this is rather expensive to run.

No more smeared DVD labels!<br /><br />On the downside; the colors on the barrels of these markers don't really correspond to the colors of their ink. It's more of a suggestion or a hint of the color you'll get when you write or color. They tend to be much darker than the displayed color. Using a test pad is a must until you get familiar with them.

Perhaps outsourcing (to the Philippines), or all the money spent on athletic advertising has taken away from any monies better spent on continuing the tradition of making great telephones. I got a 210 because I needed a basic telephone that was inexpensive and would be dependable (an ATT). Instead I got garbage. One by one features would not work. I needed a longer cord so it went to a hardware store (where the owner use to work for Verizon) and he said the telephone was defective. The cord would not work. Radio Shack said the same thing. I called the service number and got the outsource who asked me to describe a couple of the issues. I was then told it was defective and to send it back. I also said I needed an extension cord and could I get one from them? They said anyone would work. I said I did not feel I should have to spend several dollars to send a $13 telephone back (received through Amazon free shipping and I should risk receiving another defective unit?). They said they could do nothing else. I asked for a supervisor and was given a complaint email address [...] to write to about it and instead of a written reply I get a telephone call and who do you think calls me? The same outsource office. They want me to contact them so they can work something out. I email them that they can certainly send me a prepaid label with a new and working telephone and I would return the defective one in the box the new one comes in. I had not heard from them in months so I called them before the warranty ran out to ask why did you have to speak with me and not respond to my emails. I was told we prefer to speak with our customers personally about their options. OK. What are they? I was told there were two: I could pack up the telephone and all its original contents to send back to them, or I could fill out a form received the next day authorizing a new telephone would be sent to me WITHOUT mailing in the defective one, IF I paid a pre charged $14.99 (the telephone was $12.99) fee. This allows (are they kidding?) me to continue using (I told them it was sitting in its box) the telephone until the replacement arrived. I asked she email me these `options' for my record and she did.

The software was acting strange, and apparently it took out all the photos.  That is a big chunk of my life that I will never get back.<br /><br />Even tonight the sogtware refuses to consistently save test scans.<br /><br />My original assessment was that this was a bad scanner because of the software, and I stand by it again.  If you are scanning in more than a few photos, USE AT YOUR OWN RISK!<br /><br />UPDATED REVIEW<br />I had extensive problems getting the scanner to operate and the software to install.  I had to download the drivers to three different computers.  I was never able to make it work with WIN 7 (old laptops I could place where the photos were) but did make it work with WIN 8 with tech support help.  The Web site specifically states that the driver and software will work with WIN 7.  Take it with a grain of salt.<br /><br />Scanning was easy.  I ran a calibration first and then scanned several hundred photos over about 8 hours.  The results were good EXCEPT the white balance was way off on many photos.  They looked sepia-toned.<br />Software was \"not so good\".  First, they use a white on light blue interface color scheme.  For a visually impaired person like myself, it might was well be white-on-white.  Second, there seems to be no batch processing of photos.  The white balance Quick Fix seemed to work wonders, but I was not going to do each scan individually.  My corrections were done in Photoshop instead where I could run a batch process on all the photos.<br /><br />Positives were that the hardware and software were able to rotate the scanned images to eliminate any feeding errors over 99% of the time.  Scans at 600 dpi were fast and consistent.  Having the scans start automatically when the photo was dropped into the scanner was a huge plus for this job.  While some rotation did occur, there were only three misfeeds that required a rescan because the photo stuck in the scanner feeder.<br /><br />Negatives for the setup issues and the white balance, but positives for ease of use, consistency, and speed.  I will end up saving hundreds of dollars scanning the photos myself instead of using a service bureau.", "images": [], "asin": "B01LZJH63M", "parent_asin": "B01LZJH63M", "user_id": "AE3OUW2QZVYKTDJ33WRUNO75WIXA", "timestamp": 1676139997572, "helpful_vote": 4, "verified_purchase": true}

{"rating": 1.0, "title": "Ooma - poor CS and won't let you take your original number with you.", "text": "I was a bit hesitant to buy my Ooma due to the cost yet after a co-worker raved about it I did it.  I bought my Ooma Telo box from Costco.com- they ran a special whereas you not only got the Ooma box but also the Bluetooth wireless adapter.  I saw a few Ooma boxes on sale at my local Meijer store for $139- a steal (of course, no Bluetooth adapter included)!<br /><br />I've been an Ooma user since June 2011 and have nothing but praise for it!  After only 4 days of using it (with the new number Ooma gave me- I now have a second number on the same line- woo hoo!) I decided to get the Premier service- for $119 annually I was able to transfer my old Vonage number (normally cost $39 to transfer a number) and receive invaluable services.<br /><br />My favorite?  The ability to block ANY number.  Yes, including those annoying robocalls from political organizations that are exempt from the Do Not Call laws (which includes all charities- if I know I am not going to donate then I love knowing I can prevent them from contacting me).  With the upcoming presidential election I was able to block every last robocall- no more hearing from those annoying special interest groups!<br /><br />The second number is unlisted and gives me more security.  I am single and when I give out that second number if it doesn't work out with someone (who will not stop calling) I can simply stop the calls by putting their number on my personal blacklist- another Ooma Premier feature.<br /><br />Call quality is pretty good- I would rate it better than a Verizon cell phone call (Verizon's call quality is pretty good IMHO).  Because this is an internet based phone service (VOIP) I sometimes find if I am surfing the web and talking on the phone the call quality can deteriorate so I now use the service without using my computer too.  it is a small sacrifice to pay for such a cheap and awesome service.<br /><br />Even by buying the Premier service my monthly cost for unlimited calling to the US and Canada is less than $15/month.  I haven't found ANY other service which offers so much at a lower cost.  If you don't buy the Premier service your only cost after buying the equipment is monthly taxes- currently it is around $4.50 for me.<br /><br />There is also an app that costs $10 that allows Ooma Premier subscribers to use 450 minutes of talk time on either Wifi or 3G monthly- I have not tried this out due to overwhelmingly negative reviews of the app on the Android app store.  Once I see more positive reviews I will get it- this will save me even more on my cell minutes.<br /><br />I highly recommend Ooma- GREAT service!<br /><br />UPDATE: June 4th, 2018... Ooma apparently will do everything in their power to prevent you from leaving them and porting your phone number elsewhere. I've tried 10 times to port my original AT&T number from Ooma to a TMobile account... No dice. Ooma will not give out any info to help and everything I've read on the web hasn't worked.

I have advanced systemic RA so my hands are in bad shape, but even if they weren't I found the Pilot Dr. Grip pen to be too thick since it has a 5/8&#34; diameter at the middle (widest area) and a 9/16&#34; diameter at the finger depression (too fat for my comfort).  To replace a refill on most pens, the pen comes apart at the middle of the pen's barrel (where the silver tone ring is located).  You would think that the Pilot Dr. Grip also unscrews in that area, but it doesn't.  It comes apart at the tip, below the cushioned grip.  A pen tip is not the most comfortable place for an arthritic to grab and twist so what were the manufacturers and the Arthritis Foundation thinking?.  This pen is probably good for someone with non-disabled large hands who likes the feel of a wide girth barrel.<br /><br />As a comparison, I like the thickness and feel of the Bic Velocity pen, which has a diameter of about 7/16&#34;.  Similar to Dr. Grip, Bic Velocity has a rubberized cushion grip, but I find the Bic a bit thinner and easier to hold and use. The cushioned grip of Dr. Grip, unlike the Bic's rubberized grip, attracts dust like a magnet.  For additional comparison, I also like the feel of thinner cushioned inexpensive non-gel pens like the Bic Atlantis  and the Paper Mate Profile.  So, why did I buy Dr. Grip?  I searched for a gel pen with a comfortable hold and Dr. Grip popped up.  I have tried other gel pens in the past and I wasn't pleased with the quality and flow of the gel.  Dr. Grip also disappoints in that area b/c it skips as it writes.  I have since looked for a gel pen under the manufacturer names that I mentioned above and found nothing that I'd like.  A customer recommended the Uni-ball Signo 207, which looks stylish, allegedly writes smoothly and boldly, and accepts refills so I'm going to try it.  Hopefully, I'll like it.

{"rating": 3.0, "title": "Little Annoyances", "text": "UPDATE: The original review appears below<br />I finally got fed up with this Samsung printer and bought the HP 1102w, which is designed similarly to my old HP 1018.  I haven't used the HP yet because I had planned to use up the cartridge on the Samsung before I placed it in storage.  Yesterday, I was anxious to print the first sixty pages of my latest project and inserted about three eigths inch of HP paper into the Samsung.  That was too much for it to handle, for it chewed up the first page and creased approximately two more sheets.  Luckily, there wasn't a paper jam.  However, that annoyance was enough to convince me to activate the HP and hold onto this Samsung for acetate printing or other stuff that could be a little rough on the favored HP.<br /><br />ORIGINAL REVIEW<br />I have mixed feelings about the Samsung ML-2165W black & white/monochrome laser printer.  I wanted to replace my almost six-year-old HP 1018, which still functioned, but needed serious cleaning that involved dismantling, something I can no longer do because of arthritis.  HP has a model that is practically identical to the 1018, but I wanted something smaller and lighter.  The Samsung ML-2165W fit the bill at under nine pounds, so I truly like the weight and size.  I also like the fact that unlike the HP compact models, the Samsung's USB jack isn't recessed into a cavity that is difficult to access with arthritic fingers.<br /><br />After getting the Samsung out of the box, I discovered that it also has its drawbacks, and I probably would have been better off with an HP compact model, for I have encountered very annoying design problems with the Samsung.  Two items on the Samsung were designed backwards.<br /><br />The first design flaw is with the cartridge.  You remove normal laser cartridges by slipping your fingers under a handhold or groove and pulling up, usually at an angle - that works well when you're working against gravity.  The Samsung cartridge's groove is on top and you cannot slip your fingers under anything to pull up at the correct angle.  The cartridge is preinstalled, and you're advised to remove it, shake it, and reinstall it.  I grabbed it as best I could, but each time I pulled, the entire printer lifted off the desk and the cartridge didn't budge.  Luckily, I have a set of miniature crowbars, and I used them to dislodge and refit the cartridge at the proper angle.<br /><br />The second design flaw is the width-graduating lever for the paper tray.  That too is backwards, and it wasn't easy for me to adjust the width to the 8 \u00bd inch setting, which is as far as it should go, but fails to expand to that full size.  To increase the width to the maximum setting, you need to squeeze a clip between your thumb and index finger and glide the clip all the way to the right.  The problem is that the release lever is on the right, instead of on the left, where it would make the most sense and would permit you to flush the clip against the printer's frame to get the full 8 \u00bd\" width and hopefully allow for some play.  The location of the lever prevents that from happening because your finger will end up pinned between the lever and the printer's frame.  A pair of needle nose pliers may remedy that, but I don't know where mine are.  The end result is that 8 \u00bd\" X 11\" paper fits so snugly within the tray that it's hard to accommodate more than a few sheets at a time due to the lack of play.<br /><br />Other annoying little things: The printer is only about a week old, and I already notice that the top page can end up smudged while it sits on the feed tray under the pick-up roller.  That's an indication that something may not be quite right with the cartridge or other mechanism(s).  Secondly, compared to the HP 1018, the Samsung is whiney noisy.  I hope I get used to it.<br /><br />SUMMARY<br />The attributes: It's light; it's small; prints well, but not great because the grayscale isn't up to par; has easy plug USB and power jacks; it's also wireless; driver Windows and Mac updates are easy to acquire; it arrived within twenty-four hours and cost me only $87.09 after a $50 instant rebate at Staples.  You can't get an HP for that price, but an HP LaserJet printer functions nicely.<br /><br />Negatives: Has two annoying \"backward\" designs, making it difficult to remove/install the cartridge and paper; it doesn't have a separate feeder tray for envelopes and postcards; grayscale print is disappointing; and it whines.", "images": [], "asin": "B006TZGJGO", "parent_asin": "B006TZGJGO", "user_id": "AEN2NKUOAXGNLLT6DCQDQ2LK7M6Q", "timestamp": 1339710960000, "helpful_vote": 52, "verified_purchase": false}
{"rating": 3.0, "title": "Not as Advertised", "text": "I had three main concerns as I studied several luggage carts on line.  They were sturdiness, wheel size, and handle design.  This Norris cart meets two of the criteria and others that I did not consider.  It's a sturdy cart and the wheel base is as it appears in the image, but the handle isn't bent at a ninety degree angle as shown.<br /><br />I've owned carts with straight handles and they present a problem when the cargo extends above the cart's height.  At that point, in order to get a grip, you'll have to squeeze your fingers between the cargo and the handle.  The experience can be uncomfortable and/or painful, depending on the weight and design of what you're lugging.  So, I wasn't happy when I discovered that the two carts that I ordered each have straight handles.  I'm not returning them, however, because sometimes I can't be bothered.<br /><br />In the picture, you'll notice that midway down from the handle, there's a section that resembles the hypotenuse of a triangle.  It extends from that midpoint to the opposite base.  I thought that was a metal piece because I've seen something similar on other carts, which helps to secure whatever you're carrying.  Well, since the carts that I received don't have that metallic retainer, I surmise that what I see in the picture may be the black bungee cord, which does come with each cart.<br /><br />In addition to sturdiness and solid large wheels that permit you to pull the cart with ease, the other amenity that I like on this cart is the base.  At the base, you can fold down the front metal piece, giving you extra height and equalizing the front of the cart with the wheels' radius.  That's a plus in case you have to lift a package from the bottom; you won't have to scrape your fingers on the pavement.  At the base, there are also two metal sections that fold out to each side, making it easier to balance the cargo.  When you fold those pieces in, they and two other metal rods that extend along the length of the base may help to prevent a small package from slipping through the bottom.<br /><br />Finally, the cart opens and closes easily.  The only downside that I find with luggage carts in general is that once folded, they don't remain upright.  Someone should include a pedestal that you can easily pull or kick out in order to keep a folded cart in a standing position when necessary.  Overall: It's a good cart.", "images": [], "asin": "B0032FPIBG", "parent_asin": "B0032FPIBG", "user_id": "AEN2NKUOAXGNLLT6DCQDQ2LK7M6Q", "timestamp": 1338661316000, "helpful_vote": 3, "verified_purchase": true}

{"rating": 3.0, "title": "HP and the half-cocked printer (sorry JK Rowling)", "text": "What I find puzzling is why HP continues to churn out new printers even before the latest models are put on display, making all sorts of changes, but ignoring completely the old problems that are handed down from generation to generation.<br /><br />Like its predecessors, this fancy-shmancy printer promises much for people who need to create posters, flyers, banners and so on, but as usual fails to deliver the goods.<br /><br />It works great for the ordinary stuff - printing letter sized documents from e-mail, Word, Excel etc. with all the settings on \"normal\", and even does pretty well printing high resolution pictures on photographic paper, but when it has to get down to anything more complicated, it shivers, balks and then goes into a blind panic, creating havoc and paper destruction with wild abandon.<br /><br />Firstly, this one uses completely different ink cartridges to previous printers, and to add insult to injury, these are smaller than the old ones. Even though there's a very helpful feature that tells you how much ink you have left, it only serves to annoy you when you see that you are just two days away from shelling out more money for new cartridges.<br /><br />Secondly, my previous HP printer allowed me to create a letter-sized document and then enlarge it to 11\" x 17\" with a couple of clicks.  If this one has that feature it's too well hidden for me to find it, and I gave up trying.  If you need a flyer done, and were thinking of blowing it up to make a matching poster - the least irritating way is to change the paper size settings and just enlarge everything manually.  If you only need a poster, make sure you set the size first.  On the subject of size, this printer assumes you know the dimensions of paper with the codes A3, A4 and so on, and only by \"Googling\" did I confirm that 11 x 17 goes by the alias \"tabloid\".<br /><br />If you need to print a bundle of flyers, and planned to print them in the economy fast mode, don't even consider setting it to 25 and going for coffee.  Even if you fan the paper until your co-workers complain about the chill, the printer will work itself up into a frenzy, and begin printing your document in random pieces on multiple sheets of paper, and spitting the results at you with almost religious fervor.  You also have to remember to indicate that you don't need the two-sided printing, or you'll get a bunch of blank pages in the middle of the pile of 150 sheets it used to print your 25 flyers, most of which look like bits of a jigsaw puzzle.<br /><br />The \"Cancel Print\" button still doesn't work properly, and you'll have a lot of wasted paper if you need to stop a print job.  The control buttons have now been moved from the right hand side like every other printer I've ever owned, and are now on the left hand side, so that I have to do yoga stretches over the desk to get to them.<br /><br />On the good side, it prints regular documents quickly and with good quality, and once you have your paper sizes set up correctly, it prints 11 x 17 and 13 x 19 posters.  Time will tell whether the rollers have been improved on this model, as the last one refused to pick up cardboard or large paper sizes after a few months.<br /><br />I'm beginning to think that the printer's devil has split its soul into multiple parts, and is using HP printers as horcruxes.

I buy the best I can afford, and use them until they are worn out.<br /><br />A couple years ago, I bought a very expensive Canon home inkjet printer. I use it to print patterns, as well as correspondence or shipping labels. It is no secret that ink costs a fortune. Most cartridges have dense sponges in them, which helps control the release of the ink so it does not spot on your printing project.<br /><br />When I saw generic cartridges for my printer, I thought I'd see what the quality was like. I have to say, I was disappointed. While the sizing looks to be spot-on, there is only a tiny piece of sponge in these, and mostly liquid with the viscosity of water. It looks like water with food coloring in it. Yuck.<br /><br />If you have a very old printer that you don't care about, these will probably work ok for that. With newer printers, you can actually void your warranty by using off-brand ink cartridges in them. Mine is likely out of the warranty period. I am choosing to NOT put these in my machine, as I can't afford to replace a printer right now. I truly do not trust what looks to be colored water not just running throughout the printer.

{"rating": 2.0, "title": "This was my LAST HP printer!!", "text": "Well, I've been a faithful HP customer since the late 1980's.<br />I've had 3 HP printers, but this one is my LAST!!<br /><br />I bought this model to use in my home office - basic stuff like<br />scanning papers or photos, printing shipping or address labels.<br />Not exactly new technology we're talking about here.<br /><br />This printer is THE WORST!<br />For some reason, HP decided I was no longer smart enough to know how to check my<br />ink levels or align my printer, and wanted to do it for me. Well, okay, but here's the<br />kicker - EACH AND EVERY TIME YOU CHANGE EVEN ONE INK CARTRIDGE, this printer will print out<br />an \"alignment page\" that uses quite a bit of black ink, and also a little color ink.<br />EACH TIME. Also EACH TIME, I have to scan the stupid printout to make sure it is still \"aligned\".<br /><br />You know, I used to be able to decide for myself if the printer was a little off, or the quality<br />wasn't what I was looking for.  Those days are gone, and in their place is this ridiculous system<br />that not only forces a scan each time (and they are pretty slow), but wastes way too much ink.<br />HP ink is NOT cheap, and they are making sure you need it more often by these ridiculous alignment pages.<br />So far tonight, I changed the black ink cartridge, and it has printed out the alignment sheet TWICE,<br />despite my doing the scan. It didn't \"take\" somehow.  So now I have two of these asinine sheets using<br />up my ink and still can't print a recipe yet.<br /><br />Then let's touch base on the scanner. It does just fine for photos and flat papers.<br />If you have something that is 3D, then you are out of luck!  I used to scan beads for selling<br />craft supplies online. My old HP scanner did a fantastic job on the scans, and I had better pictures of<br />the items than I could get with a digital camera. Then came the upgrades. I was forced to change to Vista<br />when my old HP computer bit the dust. I bought a new HP Pavilion with Vista preinstalled. I tried to hook up<br />my old scanner, and could not! The scanner wasn't that old and still worked great, but XP was the last supported program<br />for it, and HP would not put out an updated driver for it. (Grrrrr! Stop shaking me down to buy more equipment!)<br /><br />Well, I had to have something, so I bought this all-in-one. I REALLY regret it now.<br />The scanner CANNOT do 3D items - you only get shadows on the edges, and only the parts actually touching<br />the glass will show up clearly. Resolution doesn't matter, because it just can't read 3D.<br /><br />Then this irritating alignment sheet thing is the final deal breaker.<br />HP, you are wasting my time and my ink.  I can get any printer to print, so why pay so much more<br />for your brand printer and high-cost ink?  I'm done with you - the love affair of over a decade<br />is done.<br /><br />It is very sad how HP quality continues to decline (was it because they merged with Compaq, or did they stop<br />caring about the quality of the products?). After having owned 4 Pavilion computers, 4 HP digital cameras,<br />3 printers and 1 scanner, I can say that I am no longer a loyal HP customer. They just don't care about the<br />product OR the customer any more, so it is time to be reciprocal in the lack of love. (And yes, I wrote to<br />customer service about it, and never received anything but the form email saying they got my email - never a<br />response, never an answer.)<br /><br />Bye bye HP - it's time we broke up, and you take this piece of junk printer with you.", "images": [], "asin": "B002QEI0I2", "parent_asin": "B002QEI0I2", "user_id": "AFTEMMCIMU62ONZHLLXEXSME4Z6Q", "timestamp": 1304314212000, "helpful_vote": 4, "verified_purchase": false}

I also use a lot of Teresa Collins papers in my work (I just finished a set of cards using her \"Sweet Afternoon\" papers [[ASIN:B007Y7Q2JU Teresa Collins Designs Sweet Afternoon 6 by 6-Inch Pad]] ).  So I was happy to check out this adhesive kit.<br /><br />It contains the most commonly used adhesives for paper crafting: clear liquid adhesive, foam squares, double-sided tape, tape runner, and sticker maker, along with a sponge you can use to \"clean up\" any stray bits of adhesive, all packaged in a nice pink box.<br /><br />The products are fine -- they're decent quality, they do what they're supposed to do.  The clear adhesive works well to stick buttons, fabric flowers, etc. to paper; it also works nicely to add gloss accents.  I use a lot of double-sided tape when I make my folders to hold packs of cards, and the double-sided tape included here works fine, although you don't get a lot of it.  The tape runner is also nice quality, similar to others on the market.<br /><br />But I do have a few quibbles.  The foam squares are way too thick for most card-making uses.  I usually use 1/32\"-thick squares so that I can have multiple layers; using these, I can only use a single layer; otherwise, the card is too thick for mailing in a \"regular\" envelope.  Also, the Xyron sticker maker allows you to make stickers only 1\" wide, which is rather narrow.  It's great for sticking ribbon, but not so good for creating stick-on flowers (for example) or other shapes.<br /><br />If you just want to try out some of these items, this might be a decent way to get all of them together.

{"rating": 3.0, "title": "Sturdy, functional, nice size ... but don't expect a long life ...", "text": "UPDATE: Feb 14. 2016<br />Mine bit the dust this week.  The weld that holds the desktop to the middle support bar failed.  It actually started splitting about 4 months ago, and I tried several options (various glues) to stabilize it, but nothing worked, and this past week it finally reached a point where it was just too &#34;wobbly&#34; to be usable.<br /><br />This was used daily to hold my MacBook Air 13&#34; (so not a lot of weight) plus a coffee cup or bottle of iced tea.  Occasionally I used it for crafts projects (mostly coloring stamped images to use on handmade greeting cards, so we're talking a clipboard and some colored pencils).  I was careful to move it by holding the middle support, not the desktop.<br /><br />So ... bottom line, it performed nicely for about 2.5 years, but daily use (not anything heavy) caused a critical weld to split.  I would have expected a little more -- 5 years, perhaps.  (I've replaced it with a slightly less attractive but probably more practical stand ... )<br /><br />ORIGINAL REVIEW:<br />I purchased this to use in the living room for my laptop and crafts projects.<br /><br />I'm no spring chicken, and I'm sometimes a bit &#34;hardware challenged,&#34; but I was able to assemble this by myself in less than 15 minutes.  The instructions are fairly clear, and as long as you're careful to get things turned the right way, it will go together smoothly.  All tools are included in the parts packet, so you don't even need a screwdriver.<br /><br />The size of the &#34;table&#34; is impressive for a stand/cart of this price.  It's more than large enough to hold my MacBook Pro 15&#34; plus my Akai LPK25 keyboard that I use for composing music.  This gets me out of my office (where I have an 88-key Alesis keyboard for composition), and into the living room which has a lovely view of the garden.<br /><br />I also use it for some of my crafts work -- assembling handcrafted greeting cards, preparing and coloring stamped images, making bows and trims, etc.  Again, the size gives me a lot of real estate to play with.  I can spread out a lot of &#34;stuff.&#34;<br /><br />It feels sturdy, too -- no wobble, nothing &#34;flimsy&#34; about it at all.  I wish it had a &#34;tilt&#34; function for the table, but I can get a tilt just by turning the top 180 degrees (hard to explain, but it works).<br /><br />Also, the platform with the wheels is a bit too high to fit under my sofa, so I've had to raise my sofa about 2&#34; so that it will clear.  Small price to pay for the convenience.<br /><br />Anyway, the bottom line for me is: does it work for my uses? and does it look like I won't have to replace it soon?

Some colors are better than others (primary), some could be more robust (metallic).<br /><br />The case is nice, HOWEVER, it is not designed the same as shown in the product pictures. The pictures show that the pens are situated on both sides of the case. Mine are situated directly in the center. SEE MY PICS.<br />Zips fully open. Easy to open, easy to close.<br /><br />Be mindful of the surface you use these on. It may leave a haze of color. I was able to get out remaining color with use of a bleach cleaner. I will stick to chalkboard use only.<br /><br />I selected these because I wanted more colorful chalk than what I have. I have the typical dry dull looking sticks.  Why does it matter? Because I have fun doodling on a wall hung chalkboard situated at our main house door. It was here well before we moved in (20+ years) ago, and with just two adults in the house, it really serves no purpose. So I took to making terribad art on it. I make some quick doodles every once in awhile for the sheer fun of it. Adding in more color allows me to more options. I enjoy the process of creating a images with chalk.<br /><br /> Overall, I like the colors, I dont like how long it takes to prime each one, and I have to do this nearly every time. Maybe thats the norm? Can leave haze on some surfaces, case wasn't as expected. I give them 3 stars because I think they (and my overall experience) have been\"OK\".", "images": [{"small_image_url": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/6181aHVWKUL._SL256_.jpg", "medium_image_url": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/6181aHVWKUL._SL800_.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/6181aHVWKUL._SL1600_.jpg", "attachment_type": "IMAGE"}, {"small_image_url": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61yyz8HddEL._SL256_.jpg", "medium_image_url": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61yyz8HddEL._SL800_.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61yyz8HddEL._SL1600_.jpg", "attachment_type": "IMAGE"}], "asin": "B08S1H3BTP", "parent_asin": "B08S1H3BTP", "user_id": "AF2BLE54TEMGZ546U763ZHZRXC4A", "timestamp": 1645207051510, "helpful_vote": 1, "verified_purchase": false}

{"rating": 2.0, "title": "Very nifty little printer that doesn't take up too much space...", "text": "[[VIDEOID:2224c3c8a3671b727e953c0bc8b3003a]] FEB 5, 2022 UPDATE:<br />-------------------------<br />The AR feature in which I described as magic in my review below worked for one day. LOL! What you do is you select a video clip from your phone in the HeyPhoto app, you trim a 15 second clip of your video, then you choose a still image from that video to print. Then when you use the HeyPhoto app to scan that photo, it'll play the clip. It's pretty cool, just as the advertised. But for whatever reason, this app has stopped working. We uninstalled and reinstalled app too, so now I think we lost the effects for the previous photos we printed. Still does not work. This product has given so much headache from day 1. It's still good just to print regular photos. I'm downgrading to 2-Stars.<br /><br />JAN 26, 2022 UPDATE:<br />---------------------------<br />Okay, so just as suspected, my issues in my original review were all due to a faulty ribbon cassette. I've since gotten a replacement ribbon, and the printer is working fine. I still believe they should go back to the drawing board and re-write their manual to include troubleshooting tips. I've uploaded a video to show you the printing process. It lays down a single color film with each passage. The picture comes out quite impressive, but of course it's a little dull compared to how it shows on your phone. So I suggest you only print pictures that are bright and colorful on your phone. Those will show up best when printed out. The AR feature is also very neat. It's like a magic trick. I think with the invention of the smartphone, we are printing less and less. We just look at photos on our phones. So I think a product like this makes a lot of sense. It's for printing occasionally, and for something that won't be used often, it's nice that it won't take up much desktop space. I'm bumping this up to 4-Stars.<br /><br />ORIGINAL REVIEW:<br />-----------------------<br />Well, this has been a disaster so far. I got this printer because I really liked their little 3x2 zink printer. Now this 4x6 printer requires a ribbon. This is the year 2022, I don't think I'm the only one who is in the dark about ribbon technology. Not that I'm a young buck, but the last time I dealt with ribbons was in the 80's and 90's. What I'm getting at is there should be some introduction in the manual explaining how this ribbon prints on their paper, and a section on troubleshooting issues. None of this is in the manual. On my first print, the printer made all sorts of sounds, then the button started blinking red, I knew I was in trouble. The ribbon got all wrinkled and crumpled up inside. A troubleshooting section on how to remove a ribbon jam would have been nice.<br /><br />This is a vine review, but I paid for their ribbon/paper package in order to test this out and write this review. I consider myself pretty good with tech, and I'm 99.99% sure this wasn't user error. When I removed the ribbon from its package, it seemed a little loose to me, but what can I do? Should I adjust it, should I tighten it, how do I do that? There doesn't seem to be any moving parts on the ribbon. Nothing can be adjusted. Troubleshooting tips didn't come with the ribbon package either. So I gave their product the benefit of the doubt, that nothing's wrong. I pushed the ribbon into the printer and I heard a click, so all is well. On the first print, everything got jammed up with no troubleshooting manual to turn to.<br /><br />Bottom line, documentation needs to be better. They need to think in advance and anticipate these issues like every printer on the market does. This is 1-Star so far until I get this sorted out.", "images": [{"small_image_url": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/518kK1D1gpL._SL256_.jpg", "medium_image_url": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/518kK1D1gpL._SL800_.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/518kK1D1gpL._SL1600_.jpg", "attachment_type": "IMAGE"}, {"small_image_url": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51BfF0j6nsL._SL256_.jpg", "medium_image_url": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51BfF0j6nsL._SL800_.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51BfF0j6nsL._SL1600_.jpg", "attachment_type": "IMAGE"}, {"small_image_url": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51QIAO4klIL._SL256_.jpg", "medium_image_url": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51QIAO4klIL._SL800_.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51QIAO4klIL._SL1600_.jpg", "attachment_type": "IMAGE"}, {"small_image_url": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51kBtTm9lgL._SL256_.jpg", "medium_image_url": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51kBtTm9lgL._SL800_.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51kBtTm9lgL._SL1600_.jpg", "attachment_type": "IMAGE"}, {"small_image_url": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/618g3UCu3BL._SL256_.jpg", "medium_image_url": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/618g3UCu3BL._SL800_.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/618g3UCu3BL._SL1600_.jpg", "attachment_type": "IMAGE"}, {"small_image_url": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61Gr1VXsoRL._SL256_.jpg", "medium_image_url": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61Gr1VXsoRL._SL800_.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61Gr1VXsoRL._SL1600_.jpg", "attachment_type": "IMAGE"}, {"small_image_url": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61KwKyPDKlL._SL256_.jpg", "medium_image_url": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61KwKyPDKlL._SL800_.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61KwKyPDKlL._SL1600_.jpg", "attachment_type": "IMAGE"}, {"small_image_url": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61NM8In3AdL._SL256_.jpg", "medium_image_url": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61NM8In3AdL._SL800_.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61NM8In3AdL._SL1600_.jpg", "attachment_type": "IMAGE"}, {"small_image_url": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61fvExLEb-L._SL256_.jpg", "medium_image_url": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61fvExLEb-L._SL800_.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61fvExLEb-L._SL1600_.jpg", "attachment_type": "IMAGE"}], "asin": "B09LHF9195", "parent_asin": "B09LHF9195", "user_id": "AHR6RGZTLOMBD7EBF3OK43JWMGNQ", "timestamp": 1641500531206, "helpful_vote": 0, "verified_purchase": false}

{"rating": 1.0, "title": "492 per roll, absolutely annoying...", "text": "September 21, 2021 UPDATE:<br />-----------------------------------<br />It gets worse... I just got a roll that had 520 labels on it, then this last roll ran out at 477. These rolls are way off! I always keep count because when you run out of labels, you have no clue how many it actually printed, or how many you're short on. So you then you have to manually count the labels by hands to know where you're at. It is time consuming and tedious. That is why I always keep count. So I don't print more than I have. I would avoid this listing. You are not getting 500 per roll.<br /><br />How can you trust that I'm not the one that's losing count? Because it's happened over and over. I'm not this bad at math. LOL! I print using photoshop. I keep a tally. For example, my latest work required printing three unique skus at 300, 150, 100 a piece. I started with a fresh roll. 300 printed no problem. Then the 150, no problem. So that's 450 used. I should have 50 left, but many of these rolls have been ending at 492. So for the last 100, I set it to 42. I'll then print the rest, 58, in the next fresh roll. I didn't even get 42, I got the \"OUT OF PAPER\" alert. Opened up my Dymo, freed the label, and started manually counting... 27. So that's 477 labels. These batches are bad.<br /><br />ORIGINAL REVIEW:<br />----------------------<br />If you're not counting, then you wouldn't be the wiser, and you'd be happy. But if you actually need to keep count of the skus you print, you will be annoyed. I don't like to print more labels than I have because the printer will say, \"OUT OF PAPER,\" and then you have to count by hand how many it printed, so you would know how many more you need to print. I avoid that situation by keeping count always. For several days, I keep messing up, I thought I was the one who was losing count. But it was very clear to me on my latest batches that the problem was the rolls, not me. I started with a fresh roll. I needed to print three different skus at 121, 200, 174, that's 495 labels. I ran out of paper at 492. This explains why I've been pulling my hair for several days. To be fair, this is my second order from them. I did not have this problem on the first order. This might be just a random issue. But it messed up my flow of work for several days.

I just figured we needed another one in the house, but when I got it, I was surprised that a pencil sharpener we've had in the house since the 1980's was still better. It was made by Panasonic and it had a light indicator & auto stop that still works to this day. Because I'm used to this light, I thought all electric sharpeners in 2020 would have it, but to my surprise, the AFMAT has no light, no auto stop. It is beaten in features by sharpener from the 80's. LOL! Also, you know how sometimes the wood on one side of the pencil just won't go away?

The markers worked well and glow decently under the light as other reviewers have mentioned, however, this board is hardly magnetic. None of the magnetic gears will stay on this board despite sticking to filing cabinets, baking sheets, etc. Thinking that maybe other magnets would work I tried it with our magnetic letters and words (the type you would place on a fridge), tiny magnetic stuffed animals, and a magnetic mirror (like the type used in kid's lockers) and none of them stick. Literally, the only magnets in our entire clinic that work are the ones that came with it. This greatly reduces its use for us and while it is a board and can be written on, a huge purpose of this purchase was the fact that it is described as magnetic.

There are vague assembly instructions on the inner lid of the cardboard box. The pieces are printed in shapes, but the assembly steps are omitted.<br /><br />I like that this is wood, which should age much better than the cardboard alternative, but I feel like the cardboard type is more sturdy overall.

{"rating": 1.0, "title": "Not Worth It", "text": "This product has a neat idea, but a poor implementation.  First off, you have to scan a QR code to find out the website address where you download their app (they really couldn't be bothered to type it out).  Then you have to download the app and sideload it because they didn't want to publish through the app store.  If you haven't done this before, it involves turning off several security features in your phone.  Next, you have to turn off the \"avoid bad wifi connections\" feature if you have that turned on (in advanced wifi settings on an Android).  Then you can finally use the app.  After doing all of that (and against my better judgement) I tried this out and found out that it only prints one color at a time, and the ink cartridge they included was yellow.  A yellow which barely shows up on white paper, and looks like a stain from popcorn oil on my skin.  It doesn't show up at all on anything else.  So if they had included a better color I might have been able to tell you how the printouts look, but as it is I can only tell you about the myriad of other flaws and not about the one main thing that I would have liked to be able to tell you about.

{"rating": 3.0, "title": "Great printing technology (Zink), bad user experience.", "text": "Polaroid has been around for a long time, but instant photos are just fascinating to me.  There's just something about having a keepsake that one can have immediately.  It's why photo booths are still so popular.<br /><br />Zink is a very very nice technology.  Doing a little bit of research, it seems to be a thermal technology, yet it can produce high-quality color photos.  Not expecting much from a small 2x3 photo paper, I was quite impressed by the quality that was produced.<br /><br />With that said, there are many Zink printers out there and the PRT 2x3 Mini Portable Bluetooth Photo Printer MT53 is not one of the better ones.  The printer itself comes with a 5-pack of photo paper and not much else.  Its directions do not point to the correct app to download and there just isn't much instructions overall.<br /><br />First, take off the top cover by sliding it off, then take the photo paper out of its package.  DO NOT throw away the piece of cardboard that is on top of the deck.  Place the entire deck, including the paper card, into the printer.  Slide the cover back on.  Unfortunately, I had a hard time with the top cover as one of its clips just would not slide back in place and I would have a gap.  It took me quite a few tries until I was successful in sliding the cover back on.  Even now, there is a gap in the cover (see my picture).<br /><br />Next, turn on the printer.  The paper sheet will be fed through and the printer will be initialized.  Now download the app.  When searching HPRT, many apps show up with no clue as to which one will actually work with the printer.  The correct app is \"HeyPhoto\".  HeyPhoto can be used without signing up for an account, which is good.  Select the correct printer (MT53) by swiping to the left.  Be careful where you swipe because the sliding action only works if you put your finger on the blank spot under the name of the printer.  Anywhere else and you'll end up selecting the printer instead of sliding.  It's quite frustrating.<br /><br />From there, it's fairly easy to choose the picture you want and even do some touchup.  When ready, tap on the printer to connect and print.<br /><br />For those who are on Android, you will notice that there is an icon in the notification tray that tells you the HeyPhoto app is still running in the background.  Tapping on it takes you to the app info screen where you can force stop the app.  This is just bad programming.<br /><br />So in the end, the printer works and the photos are of better quality than a classic polaroid, but the PRT printer makes the whole experience a pain to deal with.", "images": [{"small_image_url": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61OxNqVufEL._SL256_.jpg", "medium_image_url": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61OxNqVufEL._SL800_.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61OxNqVufEL._SL1600_.jpg", "attachment_type": "IMAGE"}, {"small_image_url": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/719FKX5PJrL._SL256_.jpg", "medium_image_url": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/719FKX5PJrL._SL800_.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/719FKX5PJrL._SL1600_.jpg", "attachment_type": "IMAGE"}, {"small_image_url": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71CJ4tKk6pL._SL256_.jpg", "medium_image_url": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71CJ4tKk6pL._SL800_.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71CJ4tKk6pL._SL1600_.jpg", "attachment_type": "IMAGE"}, {"small_image_url": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71cHdFQuLOL._SL256_.jpg", "medium_image_url": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71cHdFQuLOL._SL800_.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71cHdFQuLOL._SL1600_.jpg", "attachment_type": "IMAGE"}], "asin": "B094W3LP6W", "parent_asin": "B094W3LP6W", "user_id": "AFXAMSEN6MT4WQHSXCV4JRGXWODA", "timestamp": 1632421661791, "helpful_vote": 0, "verified_purchase": false}

It looked like garbage.<br /><br />I am seriously a cheap person and I will never buy a canon printer ever again. I've learned my lesson. Sometimes cheap is just CHEAP. I'm going back to HP.

{"rating": 2.0, "title": "Ok magnet, terrible adhesion", "text": "The good: The magnets work, you know... magnetically. They can stick to metal like your fridge, and you can use several of them for heavier items if needed. Pretty simple.<br /><br />The bad: While the magnet part sticks, the sticky adhesive back part is awful. The adhesive barely holds on to anything heavier than a paper. If you want to hold up a small dry erase board, for example, you can use as many magnets as you want, and the board will fall after a day or so. The magnets still on the fridge, just the board on the floor. They won't stay on. I even have a small light plastic name tag that fell down.<br /><br />The package itself, in fact, came with almost half the magnets off the backing paper and just floating around the the bag. I was going to ignore it as a fluke of shipping, but I see that other reviews are complaining of the same thing. And now that I've seen it fall off of things with my own eyes that aren't that heavy, I can attest to the fact that the adhesive side is utter trash. Its the product that is faulty.<br /><br />I was able to get around this by using super glue to attach the tiles to my whiteboard and plastic tag and it has been fine ever since. So you CAN make use of these by using your own glue/adhesive, but sadly I can't recommend them knowing you can buy similar products that will work out of the package. If you get this very very inexpensively, you can \"fix it\" using glue like I did. Hence 2 stars. Otherwise, I'd recommend looking elsewhere.", "images": [], "asin": "B08MB6KNTW", "parent_asin": "B08PVZF5BF", "user_id": "AGDSEYGSA5K664EUHWKV3ARDXO2Q", "timestamp": 1644216455669, "helpful_vote": 0, "verified_purchase": false}

Seriously, what kind of specific and possibly chauvinistic questions are they trying to imply on this thing? Also, as an American, no one I know calls their mother \"mum\".  This is one of those situations in which less is more, I think. They should have left the border blank, this feels odd and strangely out of place in our home, it makes me wonder who this was really designed for. The description says great for a family or student house, etc... what student house wants to know what mum is doing on Friday night, and then why have a spot that says \"the _ family\" on top?

{"rating": 2.0, "title": "Interesting printer... Update!", "text": "I have to say, this printer really does print very nicely. However, as far as &#34;fast&#34; is concerned... well, sure it's fast - once it gets going. Unfortunately though, more often than not, it takes an inordinately long time to get to the printing part. Like just now, I asked it to print one black & white page and it took about 20-30 seconds for it to get going with the actual printing. First there are a lot of gnashing, gear smashing sounds that emanate from it (every time!) that make you wonder if it's really just a printer or perhaps doubling as a garbage disposal... I have to grin every time I hear it doing those weird sounds because I swear it sounds like it's about to spit out a few nuts and bolts and then just fall apart. However, we have been using it many times daily for over 3 months now and it's still going strong, so it must be just its own little personality shining through.<br /><br />I don't recall seeing any other reviewers mention anything about the unearthly noises that this printer puts out, so I guess it must be just mine. Hope that doesn't mean it is going to be prone to a short lifecycle. Only time will tell. (Indeed. Sometimes redundancy or stating the obvious can be poetic. I have my doubts about this instance though.)<br /><br />As others have stated, it sets up quickly and inserting the cartridges and monitoring the ink levels inside them is super easy and clear. I too love the duplex printing. It does two-sided copies all by itself. No waiting for the odd numbered pages to print out, then trying to figure out how to put the stack back in properly. This puppy does it all by itself. The first time I had it do one of these, I actually sat here in awe, watching it flip 40 pages all by itself, immersing myself in the beauty of delegating a previously irksome task to the care of a capable machine.<br /><br />Today, it stopped working and we downloaded a nifty program from the HP site called &#34;HP Printer and Scan Doctor&#34;. It walked us through a few troubleshooting steps and, within less than 5 minutes, the printer was gnashing and printing merrily once again. Wonderful! That program works for many HP printers on different operating systems. I will give the link in the comments section, where it won't get erased.<br /><br />Finally, so far, with steady daily use, we have never yet had a single paper jam. Wow! How cool is that? And I forgive it today's one and only glitch so far, because it may have been my own fault. I think I pushed a couple of buttons in the wrong succession.<br /><br />12 28 2015  Update: Still going strong. Not noisy anymore either. No idea why...  But still has never had a paper jam and prints beautifully.<br /><br />07 08 2016 Update: Not so impressed anymore. After less than two years, this printer has failed. Something to do with the printhead not being recognized. Tried the fixes that were recommended on the HP site, but none of them worked. Now, my options are: I can get a $120.00 new printhead from HP, or a refurb for about $50.00 from China. But, I can also get a brand new printer (same model) for under $120.00 from a seller on Amazon. Seeing as how I'm stocked up on expensive ink cartridges, I am going for the new printer, as I can't wait through the shipping delays from China and I'm not even sure the problem will be fixed by the new printhead.<br /><br />I will also get a 4 year SquareTrade warranty to go with it this time. That oughta work a bit better than this last go-round... Still, I'm not happy.

{"rating": 2.0, "title": "Smooth writing, but lots of issues - Read updates re price & quality.", "text": "I borrowed one of these from a Staples employee when I went there yesterday and immediately noticed how smoothly this pen writes. Totally even flow, effortless glide on the paper. Feels like a top of the line fountain pen. I bought a combo pack at Staples and also two 2-packs of the green colored ones here on Amazon. I totally love this pen!<br /><br />Note: July 21, 2012. Since the first part of my review in April of this year (i.e.: a mere 3.5 months ago) the price on these pens has increased by over 60%!!!! I bought mine for $4.18 per pack of two pens back then. Typical human reaction: product gets a few good reviews and the greed kicks in. Well, I came back to buy more, but will not be doing so until the price comes down again. Way down from $6.70.<br /><br />Note: July 25, 2012. WHOA!!! Seems like somebody fell asleep at the wheel while updating this item's price... 4 days since my last update and the price has skyrocketed to a ridiculous 258%+ of what I paid for these pens in April. And I thought the $ 6.70 was an excessive price hike. I will adjust my rating when the price comes down to a reasonable level. Right now, so not worth it. These pens are not gold plated, nor do they spew magic ink. Absolutely ridiculous pricing at $14.99<br /><br />My original rating was 5 stars at $4.18 for the set. Not anymore...<br /><br />Update Oct. 22, 2012:  I see the price is coming down some now. But it's still way higher than the $4.18 I originally paid for these. I will check back again to see if reason has caught up with these merchants.<br /><br />Update: 4/25/2013: I originally gave these pens a very enthusiastic 5 stars. But now, sadly, I have had to amend my review, and not only because of the inflated pricing either. I bought a bunch of these in all the different colors last year and the writing action really is the smoothest ever. However, the body of the pen is unmitigated crap. I have been using these for about a year now and the thread is not holding up against the pressure of the pen when it is in writing mode. The bodies are now falling apart on me, one after another.

{"rating": 2.0, "title": "Stains everywhere. Beware!", "text": "I purchased 3 of these cartridges last July. I use my printer but not all that much because these toner cartridges are truly crappy and just scatter and bleed ink everywhere on the paper. So, I only finally went through the first cartridge last week. Since I have two printers, I do have some choices, fortunately. I was really hoping to use this one more, but I can really only use this printer for printing out personal stuff. Like ebooks that I don't want to read off my screen, but prefer to print out to read in the living room or dining room or elsewhere. As far as that kind of printing goes, it's mostly legible. Just waaay not clean enough to use formally or professionally.<br /><br />I waited until I was on my second cartridge before writing this review. I figured, maybe the first cartridge was just a lemon - that can happen... I did not try to exchange it at the time because I bought these before my original cartridge ran out, just to have backup ready. By the time that happened and I realized that the new cartridge was crap, it was really too late to raise the issue. I bought it from Blake Printing Supply at the time but, since I never tried to return them or even complain, I can't speak to their service or responsiveness in this situation.<br /><br />The second cartridge I started on last week seems about 70% better than the first one. Still not clean enough for formal applications, but less frustrating for my personal printing needs.<br /><br />So, if you're OK with having a cheap cartridge that makes your paper dirty, but still can print out your personal stuff relatively legibly, then go for it.

{"rating": 2.0, "title": "A lot of little issues that add up with this product", "text": "There are a lot of \u201clittle things\u201d that are odd with this product. Adjusting the table, from tilted to flat, is incredibly difficult and it sticks so you have to pull or push on it really hard. The height is a bit too high for me, even on the lowest level, to use while flat (I\u2019m 5\u201d2 so there\u2019s that). The surface is also not as \u201canti-slide\u201d as it proclaims to be, things like my phone and other objects slide right off. This would be okay if the removable bar at the bottom were longer, but this is not the case. I will say the removable stopper for the bottom is very helpful and it\u2019s size prevents it from getting in the way of your warms. The drawer is pretty small but will hold pens. One of the most annoying issues is the book/paper holder. It does not secure very well to the table for propping up an item or when putting it away underneath. It just doesn\u2019t stay and continuously falls out. It can\u2019t hold a book very well which defeats the purpose. Not worth the 60 some odd dollars in my opinion.

The directions tell you to drill while the table top is flat on the floor or table.  DO NOT do that!.  The holes don't line up!  That is a major manufacturer issue. Best to do it towards the end. Step 4 tells you to drill holes...DO NOT DO IT!  Wait till the very end.  Logically you would do it then but the pre-drilled manufacturer holes may not line up.  Mine did not.  You will have to wait till Step 11 to drill those holes...which requires you to get flat on the ground on your back while under the table.  One set of the pre-drilled holes on either end may line up with the white underbar. The other side of pre-drilled holes may not line up.  If one side lines up, then drill holes with your drill on the side making sure they line up with the white bar......and that requires that you drill through the white bar holes.  You will better understand when you get to Step 11 of the instructions.  I had 2 buddies of mine...one is an electrical engineer and the other a mechanical engineer.

Unfortunately, the stand is so wobbly that it is unusable for anything that requires typing on a laptop or writing notes, drawings, etc. on paper. (see video)  This limits it's use to a book holder, which can also be a problem if you are sensitive to motion when reading (as the book will wobble).  Second, while the product photos clearly show it being used as a standing desk, this is not feasible as the skids are so slippery that the desk will not stay put. In an attempt to rectify this I added non-skid rubber to the skids, which works fine.  Unfortunately, the desk still wobbles and is unusable, and cannot be returned because of the rubber which I added in an attempt to use the product as depicted in the manufacturer photos. This may work as a dining tray in bed, but I can't see it being usable for any sort of work or writing / drawing, etc.", "images": [{"small_image_url": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61SkerHMGmL._SL256_.jpg", "medium_image_url": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61SkerHMGmL._SL800_.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61SkerHMGmL._SL1600_.jpg", "attachment_type": "IMAGE"}], "asin": "B086WBG56J", "parent_asin": "B0C89HT5G5", "user_id": "AEIMUNNMAA4MGOQIFJKRJKTM4A5A", "timestamp": 1651160780766, "helpful_vote": 10, "verified_purchase": true}

Although Pendaflex has produced some excellent office and home filing products, I don't see a need for this.<br /><br />First of all, it's not a real notebook where you can secure your messy paperwork.  The premise is a binder with plastic inserts that will \"slide\" into the base of the binder for securing.  The binder constructed of hard plastic and you have an inside pocket, however, the plastic pocket is not durable, therefore you can see it will tear soon.  To attach the inserts, there are about 5-6 slots.  The attachments are easy enough to dislodge from the binder if needed.  There is a slot on the outside of the notebook for labeling.<br /><br />You will get an envelope with string attaching it closed.  On the outside is a smaller pocket with a flap.  This is hard plastic, not easy to get in and out of.  Then you have another item that is geared to hold maybe flash drives, and cds.  It includes two slots for CDs and two for smaller drives.  Do students still use the CDs for transferring data?<br /><br />Then you have the two secure file folders and they are geared for simply putting loose sheets into.  A string secures the closure of these files.  And, last there is a Clipboard, sturdy enough for its purpose.  Note the contraption that holds the paper does not spring open like a normal clipboard.

Also, the clip is weaker than others I have used and when it is clipped to my pocket and I pull my badge to use it, the clip isn't strong enough to stay clipped to my pocket and comes flying off - again, defeating the purpose of having the clip. 2) The lanyard - I really like the way it looks but it actually pulls my hair out of my head and/or basically slices through my hair every time I wear it. The &quot;gem&quot; edges are sharp and when my hair gets in between two of them, good-bye hair! So I can't really wear the lanyard at all (unless maybe I have my hair up?).

{"rating": 3.0, "title": "Looks Much Nicer Online Than It Is", "text": "I thought this would be a nice unit like the Knodel Bamboo Monitor Stand Riser (2 Tiers) I also received from Amazon. Alas, no. Oh, it's a clever idea that you can position the two portions in different ways (straight, corner, sideways) as in the video, but the quality of the product leaves a lot to be desired. The brown \"finish\" of the shelves is simply a veneer and you can see the lighter wood it's laid upon at every corner of the board. The instructions are pretty straightforward, but I advise you to use a Phillips head screwdriver with a lot bigger handle to make the torque of the screws a little easier to bear. At least three of the pilot holes drilled in the boards must have gone sideways, because when the screws were all put in securely I had three bulges in the wood that looked like they were going to crack if I had had to put the three screws in any more. Also, two of the boards came scratched, and I didn't pay attention and ended up putting one scratched board on \"top\" where everyone can see it.<br /><br />The worst thing about this set of shelves is that its kept packed tight in its box using a terrible styrofoam that leaves tiny little flecks of foam EVERYWHERE when you unpack the box. They give you a cloth to wipe down the boards, but with all the static electricity around in the winter you'd no sooner wipe the top of the board than all the little flecks of foam accumulated at the bottom of the board. When I finished assembling the unit I had to vacuum it, the carpet, my pants, and anything else I was near to get all those little shredded pieces of foam.

{"rating": 3.0, "title": "Nice Unit If I Could Get It to Work Properly", "text": "I think I'm exactly the opposite of everyone who got this unit; I'm thinking most people got it for photo printing. I took it because I actually wanted a scanner of my own--the scanner I use most often was issued to me to be used for teleworking, and it's seven years old--and the photo printing was just lagniappe. If nothing else, I could actually print a decent photo of my husband and send it to his mother, since we tend to save all our digital photos and post them on Facebook/my blog rather than print them out.<br /><br />The positives: document printing is great, nice dark black print, sharp, good looking. I'd willingly print a manuscript on this. The control panel is tiny, but thankfully I have small fingers. It's a bit irritating that you have to know to pull out the upper tray before printing, and sometimes you don't get it out far enough, but it's a small enough complaint.<br /><br />My problem, not the printer's: I still haven't figured out how to get it to print out the photos. I guess it takes more than positioning the photo paper properly and resizing the photo in the correct proportions, because I haven't been able to do it yet. I'll get there, but it may be at the cost of all the ink.<br /><br />The bad, for me: the scanner isn't that good (but keep reading, there may be an explanation). I scanned four old photographs from 1980. They all came out slightly blurry. I thought it might be because of the age or because these were matte finish. Nope--rescanned them on the seven-year-old HP scanner and they came out sharp and perfect.<br /><br />The really bad part: I never, ever got the software to complete loading from the CD. It got as far as the step where the computer is supposed to recognize the printer. It stops right there, saying it can't find the printer, and refuses to complete the install. The kicker? Both computers on the network can see the printer, and print from the printer! I can scan if I use the buttons on the printer itself and it saves to the computer, but I can't get into the scanner software to scan from the computer, reset the scanner to save to a different folder, etc. Perhaps the scanner needs to be set up in the software and that's why my first scan was blurry--but I don't know that because I can't access the software.<br /><br />And yes, before you ask, I contacted Epson. The technician walked me through deleting the printer from my computer and then reinstalling it, only have the install get stuck in the same place, where the computer is supposed to recognize the printer, doesn't, and won't go any further. He was baffled, so was I.

I was less successful with softer drawing pencils and also with colored pencils. Even with the nice sharpening job it did on the number 2, sometimes it would sharpen to the nice precise tip, and other times it would only sharpen one side so that the opposite side had a sheath of wood on it.<br /><br />I must confess that once it didn't work on several of the different kinds of pencils that I already use, I did not try it out on other brands of pencils, or on larger pencils I was considering buying for shading purposes. Perhaps I'm pushing the pencil or holding it at a tilt, although after the first non-centered pencil, I did deliberately try to insert the pencil as straight as possible.<br /><br />I haven't given up on it yet, but so far my old manual Boston does a more consistent job of sharpening straight.", "images": [], "asin": "B000DZAT12", "parent_asin": "B000DZAT12", "user_id": "AGNSUP65FG6GKSCQJKEH7A4YZLEQ", "timestamp": 1331834067000, "helpful_vote": 2, "verified_purchase": false}

My complaints are that the close setting doesn\u2019t close anymore and that they don\u2019t last a super long time. I\u2019ve already thrown one away as it didn\u2019t sharpen to that pin point anymore and that was after several drawings. If I find a sharpener that sharpens as well as this and lasts for years then I would switch but for now this is the one that works best for my needs. It is a bit pricey to me (about $6 at the time of this review) considering how often it will need to be replaced. I have been buying the 2-packs for that reason.<br />UPDATE:<br />Well I said if I found a better sharpener that I would switch and I did.  For about a year now I\u2019ve been using the Derwent Superpoint Manual sharpener and I love it.  I still use the T\u2019gaal sharpener when my pencils are too short to use on the Derwent.", "images": [], "asin": "B006CQW342", "parent_asin": "B0BL2W4DJJ", "user_id": "AE5XLRSINHOEYSLLZETI6V52PYGA", "timestamp": 1597548803790, "helpful_vote": 8, "verified_purchase": true}

The size is perfect. It fits well in a large purse or backpack.<br />2. The thick plastic cover is attractive and seems to be durable.<br />3. This is the perfect tool for a student (or non-student) to get organized.<br />4. It covers a school year\u2026.August 2015 thru July 2016. It is divided by the month, which is on two facing pages. Following each month is a daily option with bullets for you to write events or tasks.<br />5. Scattered throughout the planner are other items that are beneficial for students: proofreading symbols; conversions; the states and their capitals; spelling tips; maps; dates to remember and holidays.<br /><br />The cons of purchasing this planner:<br />1. It is kind of expensive ($18) for what you get.  I think someone in the market for a planner can find one that has more features (i.e., times, scratch paper, etc.) or that is just as good, if not better for less.<br />2. This planner would have been superior if there had been times that corresponded with the daily section. That is a feature that I normally look for in a planner, and is a feature that I think would appeal to some consumers\u2026although you can write in the times of the events by the bullets.<br /><br />In conclusion, while this planner is aesthetically pleasing to the eye, it is nothing special and in my humble opinion does not warrant the $18 asking price.

(2) Comfortable to hold with a nice grip. (3) writes well and is #2 (so you can use on standardized test).  And since it is a starter set, I assume that you can refill, but he hasn't had to yet.  And (5) is a brand that he knows, likes and trust.<br /><br />Now, what I don't like as a parent: (1) The price. On-line and in the stores (the price is comparable) this product is about $10. For just a single mechanical pencil that only comes with changeable erasers and grips, and NO lead refills, that's a little pricey.

If this item wasn't priced at $60 then I would have rated higher, but because it is $60 I expect much more when it comes to quality/ execution. All of the items have good weight to them and appear sturdy. My problem is how the bling is glued/ adhered to the items. The items seem to have been first wrapped or covered in a white material that looks soft/ squishy then the rhinestones were laid on top of that. I say that because you can see between the rhinestones where they were not all placed as tightly together and there were some gaps left. Also, the rhinestones seem to not all be the same size and color. Some look bigger than others and some shine brighter than others, as though they have a rainbow/ iridescent effect and the others are smaller and silver. Also, they used chain link bling for the perimeter of some of the items and then rhinestones to cover the rest of the areas and you can clearly see the difference. Some of the rhinestones are even laid on top of one another looking very tacky.

There are small picture directions on the machine, but without words. The paper directions themselves are 1-2 pages long, each in a different language. Those 1-2 pages in english provide no clear directions either... just information about the product. I ended up looking up a video (not of this machine - because the amazon page wasn't available) to try to understand how to use the machine. I ended up figuring it out and began by using 8 pages of plain white paper. This machine seemed to have a problem punching the holes through those 8 pages when the capacity says 25. I had to press kind of hard to get the holes through. Then I placed in the binding comb (amazon branded), pulled the lever back to open it up and placed the paper on the ends of the combs and pulled the lever forward and I was done.

{"rating": 2.0, "title": "Really Very Disappointing", "text": "There are so many things wrong with this desk. Some of them are issues with all of the larger bed trays/desks. Others seem exclusive to this model.<br /><br />Cons:<br />1. Legs do NOT lock (just this one) - contrary to the description, they only lock from downward pressure. But if you pick the table up, the legs can slip down, giving an uneven surface when you try to set it back down. This is my biggest issue with this table, since my laptop ended up falling off the first time I moved the table.<br />2. Instructions are terrible and contradictory (just this one?) - this is especially an issue with the book stand. Fortunately, it's pretty easy to figure out, so this is minor.<br />3. Always at a downward angle (all) - this is because, if the table starts out flat, your weight on the bed will angle it down. Until they come up with a table that will tilt the other way, this will continue to be an issue. I thought I'd be able to reverse this one, but the slots can't be flipped.<br />4. Lowest height is still too tall (all) - I have no idea why the industry assumption is that only tall people with big legs have big laptops. This makes it painful for a shorter person to type after even a short time. This can be compensated for somewhat by putting a large pillow under the person's rear, but it's still not very comfortable. I'm not sure what the fix would be, or even if there is one.<br /><br />Pros:<br />1. Pull-out tray works well for drinks (as long as they aren't too full).<br />2. Book stand works pretty well.<br />3. Pretty light weight for the size.<br /><br />Full disclosure: I'm currently trying to decide whether or not to return this item.

{"rating": 2.0, "title": "Gadgety, but NOT Practical", "text": "I hate these.<br /><br />First, the stickiness of the 'regular' Post-its are much stronger.  With the originals, I can stick and re-stick several times to our bathroom mirror (helpful for weekly reminders and the like), as well as to my office door (&#34;I'm in 248 today&#34;).  With these, they fail after one or two moves.  Even when just sticking them to a single surface, you will find that they are easier to pull/fall off.  I have tested them side-by-side, and the 'normal' notes consistently outperform these.  You can see this yourself if you stick a normal pad of Post-it notes into the pop-up dispenser.  You can pick up the dispenser with the stickiness of the normal notes, whereas the pop-ups come out 'cleanly'.  Or just put them on a table side-by-side, like I did, and see which one comes up more easily.<br /><br />Second, these are more expensive than regular Post-its.  How so, you ask?  Well, they are incredibly frustrating to use without a dispenser, so you really shouldn't buy them unless you also buy one of those.  That will set you back another $5-10 on top of the notes (although it is reusable).<br /><br />Finally, to use these with the dispenser, you HAVE to write on them AFTER you pull them off the pad.  If you are posting them to a wall or other vertical surface, this generally means sticking them to a table or some such, writing, then moving them elsewhere.  Since they are already weaker (see #1), this greatly increases the chances of them falling off by accident.<br /><br />In short, these are 'neat' and 'gadgety', but not actually practical.

I purchased a 15 drawer version (2 tiers) at the same time for my nail art supplies at the same time, although the larger one was delivered a day earlier. I assembled it just the day before and as it turned out, that was a good thing, since no assembly instructions came with the 8 drawer cart. Everything seemed to be going together fine\u2014until I started trying to insert the drawers. They were just slightly too large to slide into the slots! I loosened the bottom and top crossbars that connect the two sides and was able to get the drawers in with a bit of effort, but they could not be opened without bracing the cart and really pulling hard. Once I retightened the crossbars, it was nearly impossible. Fully assembled and appropriately tightened, the cart is wobbly and unstable and leans to one side or the other. The bigger issue is the inability to easily slide open the drawers, since that\u2019s the entire purpose of a storage cart! I considered trying to figure out ways to get the thing to be functional; I had just spent all that time putting it together. In the end though, I decided that I would very likely only be wasting more of my time with no guarantee that it would work any better.

{"rating": 2.0, "title": "One Of The Most Frustrating Experiences Yet (I WANT This To Work)", "text": "EDIT- I KNEW as soon as I wrote this review, I would find a work around.  It is not thrilling, but it works.  I had to do some extensive research to find anything with N41 in the title that fits the HPRT printer.  I ended up finding another driver dated from 2018 in Chinese which works.  The caveat is that this driver only has millimeters and not inches at all.<br /><br />BUT, I did finally find a driver that would work.  I forgot to add in my original review that the flash drive that came with this had a malfunctioning video which only played music on any player I tried it on.  I also wanted to say that all links in the manuals led to things that did not work.<br /><br />I am putting my review to 2 stars because honestly, unless you do what I did to get this thing to work, if you end up with a malfunctioning set of driver links, flash drive videos, etc, I just don't think that is acceptable for a unit of this price.<br />-----------------<br />ORIGINAL REVIEW<br /><br />I have been around tech for quite some time.  I am not a novice.  I no longer have the time to troubleshoot for days on end to make equipment work.  I was hoping for a better label experience than I had with another printer.  This one, unfortunately so far, has been WORSE.<br /><br />HOW THIS COMES<br />This comes in a box very well cushioned.  It is wrapped in plastic so if your box arrives soggy like ours did, you will have a chance of this being protected.<br /><br />INSTRUCTIONS<br />There is a flash drive included in this with instruction manual (that you have to print if you hate reading on devices), sample print out, and driver installation instructions.<br /><br />CORD<br />The cord with this is RIDICULOUSLY SHORT.  If you are going to use this at a desk that does not have an outlet really close to where you want to put this, get ready to get a suitable extension cord or power strip.  That frustrated me right off the bat.<br /><br />INSTALLATION OF DRIVER<br />I would love to tell you that this installed easily and I was on my way to try this printer.  Instead what I got was two hours of intense frustration that made me want to throw this away.  I am THAT frustrated.<br /><br />No matter what I tried to do, I could not get this driver to install.  I tried EVERYTHING I knew how, other than intense tech level investigation.  Most of you buying this would not be doing that.  I am reviewing this with you in mind.<br /><br />WHAT HAPPENED?<br />I got the software to unload in my system.  It says that the device is installed.  I have it show up as unknown.  I go in by hand to install the driver (which was unpacked already) and it still shows up as not installed.  I have tried automatic via windows, automatic via the printer company web site, and manual installation of the driver.<br /><br />PRINTING<br />I can not get this to work.  I would love to get it to work.  I would love to have a label printer I can use.  This, however, is not installing and I can not get it to install.  My parameters are Windows 10 down to 7 (tested on two devices) which are both included in the compatibility list.<br /><br />THE BOTTOM LINE<br />If I am able to get this to install and work, I will update this review.  I was putting off reviewing this for a while planning to be the hero and have the fix to get this to work if you are having issues like I have.<br /><br />MY RATING<br />ONE STAR.  I can not give any more for a device that will not install so I can not go any farther with it.  This device comes with the promise in the listing that it will be simple and easy to set up and use.  My experience has been the opposite.<br /><br />UPDATES<br />I will update if I finally am able to work with this and get it to install correctly.  I feel that I have done everything that the average person would do to install this, so until I have a work around, I will leave this as it is for now.", "images": [], "asin": "B08ZMMTTBT", "parent_asin": "B08ZMMTTBT", "user_id": "AHMG3ALUBE3FEBHODTBHP5J24YDA", "timestamp": 1635346820238, "helpful_vote": 0, "verified_purchase": false}
{"rating": 1.0, "title": "I Must Have Gotten A Defective Unit- I HATE This Thing I WANTED To Like It", "text": "I have worked with computers a lot, I used to build them, in fact.  I am not THAT bad with technology for the most part unless it is something very foreign to me.  This is a simple printer.  It should work simply.  Unfortunately, this has been one of the most frustrating experiences I have had with any electronics.<br /><br />HOW THIS IS SUPPOSED TO WORK<br />You plug in the unit both electrically and to the computer.  Then you download and unpack the driver and install the driver.  It is not difficult, although the instructions could be better.<br /><br />Once you download and install the driver, you should be good to go.<br /><br />GETTING PRINTER USED TO LABEL<br />It is easy, you get the label in the unit, turn it on, and then hold down the feeding button until it beeps once.  The unit reads the paper back and forth and is good to go- well in a perfect world, that is.  After that, you should be able to feed labels into the back of the printer, and as it needs to print it will print.<br /><br />PRINTING<br />Once the printer has read your label, then it can easily print out labels that you send to it.  Easy peasy, right?<br /><br />NOT!<br /><br />THE REAL EXPERIENCE<br />From the time I installed this printer until now, I have had nothing but problems with it.  The unit itself is crazy.  It will read the paper then the red light will flash.  Okay, so I press the right light button and it will spit out a label.  Suddenly the green light is on and the label is in place- so you try to print out a test label.<br /><br />The test label spits out and then the red light comes on.  Try reading the label again- it might spit it out and then turn red and be inoperable.  It might suck in label after label until you go through a whole stack.  It might randomly print something you tried to print an hour ago despite it being wiped from the printer queue.<br /><br />I have yet to have consistent performance of any type with this printer.  It is erratic, frustrating, and annoying at best.  Out of 15 attempts to print a label, I got two labels.  The rest would not print because the unit refused to feed labels correctly no matter what.  Out of about 60 attempts total, I got 5 labels not counting the ones that printed on top of each other twice randomly despite being wiped from the printer queue.  I didn't include those in the tally- that would make it officially 64 attempts with two double printed labels showing up.<br /><br />THE ONLY WORK AROUND IS NOT BUSINESS FRIENDLY<br />The ONLY work around I can come up with (so this unit is not a TOTAL loss) is turning off the printer after every single attempt.  I put the label in from the top singly.  Then I turn it on and hopefully the green light shows up.  I send the label I want to print to the printer..  THEN..<br /><br />WHAT HAPPENS THEN..<br />Once I do the work around about 70% of the time I get a label to print out.  It is ridiculous, clumsy, and not at all business friendly.  I wanted this unit so I could have an easier time of things printing labels for my business.  As it is now, just to print out some labels for some friends was so frustrating I just put the printer away and did not want to deal with it.  It is too erratic and frustrating.<br /><br />The work around does work, however, most of the time, so if I am desperate I will use it.  That only is practical if I want a few labels and even then there are misses that happen.<br /><br />PRINT QUALITY<br />I was able to post a picture of one of the test labels I made to test the unit.  When it printed, the quality was excellent.  It is adjustable in the software too.  I LONG to use this thing.  I really do.  I am just so frustrated with how horribly it works.  My only work around I could come up with is so laborious and slow, but it gives me labels most of the time.<br /><br />DIFFERENT LABELS<br />I even tried different labels from another company thinking that might help.  It didn't.<br /><br />THE BOTTOM LINE<br />I feel ripped off with this.  Despite the indications on our titles we still have to claim full value of these devices whether they work or not as if we got paid that money.  This is almost useless to me and I don't like using it.  I feel envious of all of the people who got a good one.  I really wanted to use this for my business but I would be better off getting a marker and coloring in everything by hand including bar codes- it is THAT BAD at times.<br /><br />MY RATING<br />ONE STAR.  I wanted so badly to have this work.  When it does print, it looks nice.  Otherwise the hours wasted on this nightmare have left me very unhappy and sorry I ever decided to try this thing.  I would love to have one that works as it should.

This seemed like the perfect opportunity. Yeah, right.<br /><br />WHAT IS THIS LIKE?<br />This comes in a green and white box.  The cartridge inside is wrapped in plastic- black plastic.  On the box is a list of instructions on how to replace the cartridge.  Seems simple, right?  WRONG.<br /><br />INSTRUCTIONS<br />The instructions show a removal of a tab which is not anywhere on the cartridge.  They have no pictures of the other protection that has to be removed, but the drawing seems to be of the same cartridge.  I spent a lot of minutes looking for this long thing that they show being removed from the cartridge, and finally gave up.<br /><br />INSTALLATION<br />I put the cartridge in the printer after shaking up well as instructed.  The printer went through all sorts of gyrations and then it told me there was a problem.  Again I took out the cartridge and reinstalled it.  It went through the same gyrations but this time, despite it not feeling like it fit as snug as the previous cartridge, it said it was ready to go.<br /><br />PRINTING<br />I tried printing with it and BAM it only printed a partial page and then stopped.<br /><br />BACK TO INSTALLATION<br />I removed the cartridge again and tried once more to install it.  Once I installed it, it finally printed.  The printing quality was not perfect, but it seemed okey.<br /><br />IT SPIT AT ME???<br />I was printing a bunch of pages, and suddenly about 30 pages into my document, the printer went nuts, the top door opened and spit the cartridge at me!!!<br /><br />I have tried and tried to get this to install correctly and it does not seem right.  The previous cartridge fits beautifully but this one just has been nothing but headaches.<br /><br />THE BOTTOM LINE<br />This was a gamble and perhaps I just got a bad cartridge.  At this point, it is an awful experience and I am frustrated.  I can not recommend this cartridge at this point.<br /><br />MY RATING<br />ONE STAR.  This has been really an annoying experience. I almost wish I had never gotten this.", "images": [], "asin": "B07XZ4Y1KV", "parent_asin": "B07XZ4Y1KV", "user_id": "AHMG3ALUBE3FEBHODTBHP5J24YDA", "timestamp": 1582647406807, "helpful_vote": 0, "verified_purchase": false}
{"rating": 2.0, "title": "Frustrated- Sticky Patches Won't Come Off Cartridges", "text": "When I got these cartridges, I did not need my ink replaced yet, but knew I would within the year so I figured I would get them and use them ASAP.  I do quite a bit of printing, so I figured it would not be too long.  Let's see what happened.<br /><br />WHAT ARE THESE LIKE?<br />These cartridges come in a very thick plastic sheath.  It is sealed well.  On each cartridge of ink there is a little thin clear sticky piece of plastic that seals the opening so that the ink does not dry out before you have to use it.  To use these, you cut open the bag and then you remove the seal and install them into the printer.<br /><br />WHAT KIND OF PRINTER DO I HAVE?<br />I have the HP Officejet Pro.  I was running low on ink for my yellow and magenta cartridges, so I thought I would try them out of the new pack before I totally ran out of ink.  Boy was I glad I did. (also tried a third, see below)<br /><br />WHAT HAPPENED?<br />Ideally, when you remove the seal of the cartridge, you install them in the printer and hopefully it will be recognized and work as all of the others.  In my case, unfortunately , I never got that far.  I was excited to try these and then when I went to remove the seal from the cartridges, they would not come off.  The corners of the clear thin plastic seal all came off and no matter what I did, I could not remove the seals from these.  I did not want to poke a hole in them because that could cause damage to the printer.  So, in essence these are unusable.<br /><br />ADDENDUM- CARTRIDGE 3<br />I tried the cyan cartridge and the seal partially came off, but not entirely.  Again, I won't take a chance ruining my printer so it is a bust for me.<br /><br />DO THESE WORK IN MY PRINTER?<br />I guess I won't know.  My other ink cartridge is plenty full so I am not going to remove it just to find out I can not use these anyway.  I guess this package of cartridges just are a bust for me.  Without being able to remove the seal, I can not use the cartridges to figure out of they will work in my printer.  I like my printer too much to ruin it just to test these out.<br /><br />THE BOTTOM LINE<br />Although this sounded good, I could not remove the seal off of the colors I needed to use.  That makes them unable to be used.  I won't ruin my printer just to test them out.<br /><br />MY RATING<br />TWO STARS.  I guess it is more like 2 and a half but I can not say if they work or not as the seals won't come off.  If I find that by some miracle the remaining cartridge works, I will update, but for now, I am up to 3 of them with seals unable to come off, so this is a bust for me.", "images": [], "asin": "B071G4PGWR", "parent_asin": "B071G4PGWR", "user_id": "AHMG3ALUBE3FEBHODTBHP5J24YDA", "timestamp": 1564755384165, "helpful_vote": 0, "verified_purchase": false}

My legs need to have a shelf to sit on quite often, and this seemed like the perfect answer.  Let's take a look.<br /><br />WHAT IS THIS LIKE?<br />This hammock is made in a concave manner so that it is not flat.  It comes in a carrying case which is made from sturdy nylon with a locking drawstring.  The band of the hammock has an adjustable buckle on it.  It is attached with rivets on both ends.<br /><br />HOW IS THE STRAP?<br />The longest the strap can be extended is 46 inches. That means if that amount goes around your desk, table, or stand, your feet will barely fit through the space between the hammock and your desk.  Because this is a loop shape, it will only fit around a maximum of 29 inch board- but that means it will be very tight- no room to put any feet into it.<br /><br />HOW DOES THIS PERFORM?<br />This is awful.  I could not find a table, desk or any other item that I could use this hammock on.  It is way too short!  Even if I could find a desk that was only 40 inches wide, that would make the hammock so high, we would be sitting in a jacknife position.<br /><br />THE BOTTOM LINE<br />This item is interesting in theory, but in practice, it just does not work.<br /><br />MY RATING<br />ONE STAR.

The problem is that sometimes the lids can get a bit oily.  I was hoping for a pen that would write on them pretty well.  This seemed perfect.  Let's see what happened..<br /><br />WHAT ARE THESE PENS LIKE?<br />These pens come in a blister pack of four with two black, a red, and a blue.  The cap goes on pretty tightly and the point is fine enough to write a word with, but not so fine that it is skinny if that makes sense.  There is an odor, but it is not that bad.<br /><br />HOW DO THESE WORK?<br />Well, these are supposed to write on oily, dusty, metal, plastic, wood, and concrete.  I tested these on plastic, metal lids for jars, plastic containers for lotion, and dusty wood.  They wrote okay on the wood, but so do a lot of things.  As for the plastic jars, I wrote on them DRY but when a little oil hit the side of the plastic container, the letter smeared so badly it was illegible.  Then it came off within a day of use.<br /><br />The metal lids I wrote on were both dry and oily.  The dry wrote okay, but when it got oil on it, it smeared too.  The oily lid, forget it.  The writing would not even go on well to begin with let alone stay there.<br /><br />THE BOTTOM LINE<br />I was hoping these would work, but in the cases I tried them in (except for wood) they just did not perform well at all.

{"rating": 2.0, "title": "Have used lightly over 2 years. Still works but I'm unimpressed and don't recommend it.", "text": "I bought this laminator - [[ASIN:B0010JEJPC Scotch Thermal Laminator 2 Roller System (TL901)]] - for $29.69 from Amazon in February 2015. It's so very definitely NOT worth the crossed out price of $80.49! It wasn't worth that then and it's not worth that now! So firstly, don't be misled by the crossed out price. I really wish Amazon would start policing these misleading crossed out prices! This laminator can currently (date of this review is 2/10/2017) be purchased through a well known online department store for $19.97 (with free shipping or free in store pick-up). You can also buy the newer version - TL902 - through another online department store for only $17.99 (with free in store pick-up). So, the crossed out price here is terribly misleading. Note: I can't 'advertise' these stores here, but go shopping with your browser and you should find it around or under $20 elsewhere as well.<br /><br />After 2 years of use, here's my review of my experience with this laminator:<br /><br />Pros: It still works fine with light use for the past 2 years. Also, I have found it can give nice results if you only want to laminate items up to 3mm thickness (so a photo by itself or with a sticker on back for instance). It will laminate nicely for a 10 minute period, without warping or scorching. So, it's okay for light duty laminating of items of limited thickness. Note: I've found mine needs to be set to the 5mm thickness if I don't want the lamination lifting soon after being laminated.<br /><br />Cons: I bought this laminator to make bookmarks for gifts using varying layers of card and photos, and later to use in my small home-based business for the same. I also planned to do cards with pressed flowers, but my machine gives bad results for any of that. I'm now looking to purchase bookmark sleeves, after 2 years of trying every way I could think of to get good results. This laminator seems incapable of laminating nicely varying layer heights of paper and card or card and pressed flowers (up to 5mm total thickness). The issues happen when I use photo paper together with thin to regular thickness card framing and backing the photos, unless it's all a uniform height (so no framing with the backing card). When using the 3mm setting the lamination lifts pretty quickly leaving ugly results. When using the 5mm setting, it may look great at first, but within a day or less the laminating film starts to lift leaving nasty marks on the card around the photo or all round the pressed flowers etc. Furthermore, I've had to be careful not to laminate for more than 10mins, or it gets too hot and starts scorching.<br /><br />Overall, I'm not pleased with this laminator. It does not meet my needs and I would not recommend it. However, it might be fine for you if all you want to do is laminate the occasional photo.", "images": [], "asin": "B0010JEJPC", "parent_asin": "B0BTPZMK4Q", "user_id": "AF3OIRLW2F7YOBFZ7D3KIOMMHAFQ", "timestamp": 1486880829000, "helpful_vote": 245, "verified_purchase": true}

{"rating": 1.0, "title": "The printer will not print black if I select black-only ...", "text": "Review after 9 months:<br /><br />- Constant print alignment problems<br />- Smearing<br />- Skipped lines<br />- Heavy color ink usage even though I almost never print color or pictures<br />- Black ink runs out fast even though I use the faded-grey draft mode for more than half my prints<br /><br />The quality problems are so persistent and grievous that I can't imagine using this for business.  I use it primarily to print worksheets for my two kids, and UPS return labels.  Every time I try to use it for something where quality matters, it disappoints.<br /><br />If this was truly low-initial-cost printer (40 dollar job), then I would accept getting what I paid for.  While this is still an inexpensive printer, the ink costs add up quickly and I will have to consider dumping this since it cannot print anything decently and is too costly to print casually.<br /><br />Note: The printer will not print black if I select black-only if even one color cartridge is reported empty.  I'm disappointed that the Epson is deliberately set up to stop printing black just because a color cartridge is out and did not allow a workaround to print black only. Shame.<br /><br />I've found the scanner produces poor image quality.  I would like to scan my children's artwork on paper, but I get better results taking a picture of it with a camera.  I suppose the scanner function works adequately if you're just using it to replace fax.<br /><br />Printing can be good quality if the right &#34;inkjet&#34; paper is used so it doesn't bleed too much.  I think this is the first inkjet I've had where I won't regret having it instead of a laser printer, but I also wouldn't replace the lasers at the office with anything like this.  It's definitely a home, personal or small office, low-productivity printer, and it has limited page sizes.  Personally, the thing I miss the most is double-sided 11x17, but admittedly that is another category/price-range.<br /><br />I have done some photo prints on this, which I would not plan to do regularly.  This is not a photo printer.  I used photo paper to print some proof-of-concepts for an offset print project.  The print quality was quite good, but the printer left roller marks with many tiny pin prick dents on the paper.  There may be an adjustment for this, but it's not worth it to me to figure out.  It was awkward enough just changing paper sizes and orientation with the poor user interface.  For photo printing, I still prefer a laser-exposure mini-lab type system (Fuji Frontier etc.) - In other words, I send it out to a service.<br /><br />I frequently have alignment problems with the printer.  I get places on the page where the image is shifted left or right.

It has a plain aluminum border and a tray.  It cost less than fancier boards in this size which can fetch up to five hundred dollars (twice the price I paid).  It arrived by freight in a battered box, but managed to avoid any damage.  It's comprised of a masonite backer board, a thin steel sheet with the porcelain finish and the aluminum border that holds the edges together.  I haven't had it long enough to know whether the porcelain finish is as durable as I'll need it to be.  The only complain I have is the flatness of the board is poor.  I hung it by the pre-installed slotted holes in the back.  I used two sturdy 50 pound wall anchors.  The problem is the board does not lie flat against the wall, nor does it stay flat.  I blame the masonite backer board.  It is inadaquate, and the mount hangars are inadaquate.  I could probably fix it by using large tube of Liquid Nails in a caulking gun and just glue the board to the wall solid the way some mirrors are mounted, but it would be permanent.  The board would be destroyed to remove it.  I will probably just try to hold it down with some double-sided tape or additional hardware.<br /><br />I don't know if the more expensive ones are better or not, but this one is utility quality.

{"rating": 2.0, "title": "Nib dries in minutes of non-use", "text": "The [[ASIN:B004MTDFHA Parker IM Black Gold Trim Fountain Pen, Medium Nib - 1760800]] is  a nice looking Parker pen which arrives in a soft box containing a single cartridge and warranty.  If there's a problem with the pen,  Parker requires a copy of your sales order because Amazon does not stamp the date of purchase on the warranty.  With this pen, use of the warranty is likely.  I'd read reviews abound with complaints regarding the faulty ink flow to the nib and the one I received is awful.  I'd also purchased an ink converter, so I know it's not the cartridge, as I've tried about a half dozen different inks.  With each, even if I leave the pen for an hour, it dries and I must either prime the converter or dip the nib into water or ink.  I was embarrassed at a meeting when the pen would not write and  I needed to sign a document.  Visually, this pen is five star.  In the hand, it's also five star.  If it worked properly, it would be a total five star value.  Unfortunately, a pen that doesn't write is worthless unless you've purchased it for another purpose.  I purchase pens to use as a tool for transporting ink to paper, so this one is a great disappointment.  I'd had a very old Parker fountain pen stolen inside of a bag and really wanted another, but this one will not replace the great pen I'd had for about forty years.  I cannot recommend this pen, particularly since there are so many really good fountain pens available currently.", "images": [], "asin": "B004MTDFHA", "parent_asin": "B07CGB88HN", "user_id": "AGCA64OUVM2TJGNN3IUXMEU7KF6Q", "timestamp": 1387502194000, "helpful_vote": 4, "verified_purchase": true}

None of the new printers match up to it. And the ad said this thing had ethernet and it didn't and then they changed the ad.  I'm very upset I didn't get my ethernet port. I do not want wireless printing... But meh, It works... But I miss my old cheap samsung. Why can't they still make/sell good cheap models like that. And I could get past all of this, but here's the killer, this printer surges past 1500 watts at startup!!!  It literally trips my APC 900 watt UPS... even when plugged into the surge only ports, I have to plug this damn thing directly into the wall or it will trip what it's plugged into. I find that to be BS!  Not happy with this purchase. It does print well though. which is what really matters. But I find myself consciously making sure it's off all the time because I'm so concerned about the power it might be using. All be it, I'm pretty sure it only happens during startup and wake from sleep. but that's crazy, My old samsung could run off a car outlet ac inverter, which is like 150 watts or less. so that means its startup surge was less than 150. I don't understand why this thing needs such a huge startup surge. Like I just can't get over it. I could bring my samsung with me traveling, not this guy, because of the power...  That's just stupid. Is it suppose to be that bad or did I get a bad one? One of the reasons I bought this is because this was the closest match to my old samsung printer. but not having and ethernet port really blows to.

I think it was on sale, I got it for exactly $7 less, or it could just have gone up in price.<br /><br />PROS AND CONS between the FIRST one and the one I JUST got this week.<br /><br />PROS re FIRST ONE:<br /><br />It was really great.  Made a big difference and I have bad discs in my back.<br /><br />It came in a box, NOT ROLLED up like a roll of paper towels and was good to go out of the box.<br /><br />Foam was perfectly balanced and cover fit really well.<br /><br />CONS:<br /><br />Well, not sure I can really call this a con re the first one, after over four and a half years, it wasn't as thick.  Still offered some comfort, but wanted to get another EXACTLY like it.<br /><br />NOW for the one I JUST got.<br /><br />PROS:<br /><br />THICKER (AFTER letting it sit and fluff for two and a half days)  AND that's where pros end.<br /><br />CONS:<br /><br />PACKAGING -  This should NOT be rolled up and expected to expand evenly.  Even after two and a half days of just letting it sit, I could run my hand over it and feel rippling.  It did NOT expand evenly.  Cover sagged a bit in places.<br /><br />COMFORT - IF you had never had the one I had first, you might find this comfortable.  Within minutes, not even hours, of sitting on this, I feel it's thicker in some places than others.  Right side expanded more than the left.  Yeah, not ideal.<br /><br />I'm not that heavy, so I can't imagine someone very large finding this super comfy for long.<br /><br />BOTTOMLINE:  IF you get one that is NOT ROLLED UP tight, if you get it good to go, you will likely like it more OR maybe some came from a different factory.  ALL I know is for seven dollars less, the one I got in 2017 was more comfy up until I got this one in Feb 2022, than this new one is NOW.<br /><br />CAVEAT EMPTOR.<br />I DID read a LOT of the reviews, both positive and negative, to see what I might expect.<br /><br />I didn't want a cushion with grooves in it, either too soft that would flatten fast or too hard.  I am in my sixties and just wanted more cushion especially for my hip and backs of my legs (I put my feet up on an ottoman).<br /><br />Got the cushion yesterday, unwrapped, and yes, did notice an odor, but not surprising, reviews had prepared me.<br /><br />I couldn't hang it outside, so put on a hanger with clips by it's tags and hung in a room I don't use much.  This morning, most of the odor seemed gone and decided to try it out.  And oh, it didn't have creases and did seem to have expanded well.<br /><br />I have on a few layers of clothing between me and the cushion.  I noted a few people mentioning the mesh fabric not the most comfy.<br /><br />PROS:<br />FITS my armless computer chair perfectly and cushions the backs of my legs near my knees, which I wanted.  SO GLAD I GOT THIS LARGE size!<br /><br />VERY COMFORTABLE - granted, I have only been sitting on it a couple hours (and I get up and down, so usually no more than an hour goes by before I am up doing something), but it is JUST what I wanted - MORE CUSHION for my bones and legs!<br /><br />DOESN'T SLIDE - I do have it on a nice fabric computer chair, not a slick chair, but I just tried moving back and forth and the cushion stays put.<br /><br />ABILITY TO EASILY CARRY AROUND - I got for this chair, but good to know I can move it to another easily.<br /><br />CONS:<br />THE COVER AND TAKING IT OFF - It doesn't seem easy to just take off and clean.  I have thought of taking a piece of fabric and adding a bit of velcro on the ends to just attach to the sides of the cushion, so I could easily just wash that.  It might make it more comfortable if I were wearing shorts to cushion against the mesh cover.<br /><br />THAT'S IT FOR NOW.  I will post again after I have used this for about a month, whether I still notice the positives or any negatives.<br /><br />GLAD I GOT IT and at the price I paid.", "images": [], "asin": "B00CVYOAUY", "parent_asin": "B00CVYOAUY", "user_id": "AEZIW242EBVLBV24LA7FKYVN7YUQ", "timestamp": 1494612251000, "helpful_vote": 6, "verified_purchase": true}

First, it is impossible, once you erase a line, to write over it with the same pen. In fact, if you try, the pen skips and sometimes just refuses to write. That negates the effect of having an erasable pen.  No thank you.  Add onto that, there appears to be not much gel in these pens, or the gel goes faster than ink would in the same size pen. I'm on my third and won't be using these again.  I know there are erasable pens out there, and I'm going to search out some with ink instead of gel, because I think that is what is causing this problem.  Don't waste your money on these if you actually think you're going to be erasing and writing over anything, because you'll have the same problem I've had.<br /><br />ORIGINAL REVIEW: The last time I tried erasable pens and ink, I was totally disappointed so these were a nice surprise. I do most of my writing on a desk pad when I'm on the phone and it is nice to be able to erase something if it isn't correct. These erase cleaning (as long as you don't have a really heavy hand when writing, then they'll erase the ink but the impression will be left on the page). The first one out of the box doesn't skip and the blue is a bluer blue than most blue ink any more, which I appreciate too, especially when I have to put my wet signature on something and can't use a black pen.", "images": [], "asin": "B0752D5DTB", "parent_asin": "B085T57PXN", "user_id": "AGJ2MGIBGBA7QV4LK4IXJULDD4IA", "timestamp": 1574088041129, "helpful_vote": 2, "verified_purchase": true}

{"rating": 2.0, "title": "Skipping is an issue initially... and it doesn't go away. Frustrating.", "text": "Gorgeous, but I didn't want this pen to just look at it. I expected it to lay down ink when I wrote with it, and that hasn't been the case. Skips, and kind of inexplicable skips. Hard to get the ink flowing again after just a few seconds. Sometimes the flow would stop in mid-stroke. I did not anticipate being disappointed with this pen.<br /><br />Nicely balanced, fits in the hand (I could stand a slightly larger pen). The cartridge was very easy to install, and once I got it to write things were going well for a short time. I set the pen down for a moment and returned to find it dry. So I tried various tricks to get the ink flowing again, mostly involving saliva and swearing in alternating yet equal amounts. I tried various kinds of paper I had on hand, from very nice smooth sketch book paper to printer paper to junk mail envelopes. The. Pen. Skips.<br /><br />Hours later: I've picked up the pen and written with it several times over the past few hours, and stored it point-down for a while. Given it a couple of shakes hoping that would get the ink flowing between the cartridge and the nib. Less skipping. I ran across a web page and suggests using the edge of a piece of paper and fitting it between the blades on the nib. Haven't gone that far yet. Now the pen seems as happy as a clam in mud at high tide. Maybe it just requires some breaking in?<br /><br />I'll keep evaluating the pen. If it writes, I'm happy. If it skips, there's a problem. Especially if you considering giving this pen as a gift.

{"rating": 2.0, "title": "Beauty Is Only Skin-Deep.  Don't Waste Your Money.", "text": "I'm notorious for having bad luck with phones: VTech, Uniden, and now Panasonic are on my \"Never Buy Again\" List.  However, I simply couldn't resist the appeal of the new Uniden 5.8Ghz; so against my better judgment, I bought the Uniden's Latest and Greatest Effort two days ago.  It only took about a dozen calls for me to decide that this phone is going back!<br />First of all, I have to say that this phone is very attractive.  With a striking appearance and features such as speakerphones on each handset, and distinctive rings, it's just, plain cool!  But...FOR THE PRICE, I strongly feel that the negative outweighs the positive.  The range on this phone is SUPPOSED to be more than TWICE that of a 2.4Gz phone.  NOT AT ALL!  Not only isn't it BETTER than my 2.4Ghz Panasonic, but it's actually MUCH WORSE!  I can take my Panasonic to a neighbor's house a few doors down the stret.  The Uniden crackles the second I step foot in the backyard!  And not only is it static-y, but people I'm talking to actually miss chunks of what I'm saying.  My 900Mhz BellSouth LITERALLY has better reception in my yard than this piece of junk!<br />There's more, too.  Something I was willing to overlook to have the best was the fact that you cannot expand this \"expandable\" system beyond two handsets.  I've also discovered that (like Sony's expandable) you cannot use more than one handset (or base unit) at once, so if two people want to talk to Grandma on Christmas, you'd better have a backup phone available.  Additionally, (like AT&T's expandable) when you enter information into one handset, it does not automatically transfer to the other one, so you must enter your phonebook in TWICE!<br />Folks, I know that this is a great looking, and very tempting buy....especially for all you techy, gadget-loving people (like me).  However, my recommendation would be to stick with a 2.4Ghz model until the 5.8Ghz technology has been perfected and prices come down.  I wanted VERY much to love this phone, but there's simply too many negative points to overlook.  I have NO PROBLEM spending [$$$]on a phone that works well.  However, this phone is does not deliver on the performance end, and in my opinion, in not worth the money.<br />PROS:<br />Great, Sleek appearance<br />Unique, soft-red backlight<br />Speakerphone in each handset (though of questionable quality)<br />Good sound quality close to base unit<br />One-touch auto-dial<br />Buttons have nice feel<br />Ease of operation<br />CONS:<br />Extremely poor range - especially for what it's SUPPOSED to have<br />Only expandable to two handsets<br />Cannot use more than one handset (or base unit) at one time<br />Cheek hits \"Talk\" button when resting on shoulder<br />Hand covers speaker when talking<br />(Speculation, but looks/feels like the paint will wear-off easily)<br />Price", "images": [], "asin": "B00006JSV6", "parent_asin": "B00006JSV6", "user_id": "AEB3MEBNPWWDYLQVF23WL264DI3A", "timestamp": 1039546956000, "helpful_vote": 90, "verified_purchase": false}
